{"pretrained_model_name": "e-tony/gpt2-rnm", "description": "### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. Since the generation relies on some randomness, we\nset a seed for reproducibility:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline, set_seed\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='e-tony/gpt2-rnm')\n>>> set_seed(42)\n>>> generator(\"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty: \", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=5)\n\n[{'generated_text': \"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty:  I didn't want to have children. It was my fate! I'll pay my mom and dad.\\nSnuffles:  Well, at least we\"}, \n {'generated_text': \"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty:  you know what happened?\\n(Steven begins dragging people down the toilet with his hand. As Steven falls) The whole thing starts.\\nA man approaches Steven\"}, \n {'generated_text': \"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty:  Oh wait! And do you remember what I did to you?\\nJerry:  Uh, it didn't hurt. It should have hurt a lot since I\"}, \n {'generated_text': \"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty:  Rick!\\nKraven:  Wait! [wary gasp] What the hell are you doing this time?!\\nJerry:  Hey, are you\"}, \n {'generated_text': \"Rick: I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!\\nMorty:  Uh.\\nJerry:  You don't have to put your finger on me today, do you?\\nRick:  It's just, what do you\"}]\n```\n\n### Training data\nWe used the original `gpt2` model and fine-tuned it on [Rick and Morty transcripts](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Transcripts).\n", "size_bytes": "510408315", "downloads": 101}
