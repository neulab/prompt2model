It **will** output X-rated content under certain circumstances.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe fine-tuning dataset consisted of 56MB of dialogue data gathered from multiple sources, which includes both real _and_ partially machine-generated conversations.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nFine-tuning was done using [ColossalAI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) (specifically, with a slightly modified version of their [OPT fine-tune example](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/blob/78509124d32b63b7fc36f6508e0576a326d51422/examples/language/opt/run_clm.py)) for around 11.4 million tokens over 5440 steps on a single 24GB GPU. The run took just under 21 hours.\n\n## Intended use\n\n### The easy way\n\nWe provide a notebook with a Gradio UI for playing around with the model without having to manually format inputs. This notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/gradio-ui/blob/master/notebooks/GPU.ipynb).\n\n### The manual way\n\nThe model can be used as a regular text generation model, but it'll perform best if the input prompt adheres to the following format:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]'s Persona: [A few sentences about the character you want the model to play]\n\n[DIALOGUE HISTORY]\nYou: [Your input message here]\n[CHARACTER]:\n```\n\nWhere `[CHARACTER] `is, as you can probably guess, the name of the character you want the model to portray, and `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` is chat history so the model can have some conversational context to draw from. Ideally it'll be pairs of messages like:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\n```\n\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn't get confused as to what's conversation history vs. character definition.\n\n## Known issues\n\n- The model can get stuck repeating certain phrases, or sometimes even entire sentences.\n  - We believe this is due to that behavior being present in the training data itself, and plan to investigate and adjust accordingly for future versions.\n", "size_bytes": "2930076797", "downloads": 8755}
