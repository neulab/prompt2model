It **will** output X-rated content under certain circumstances.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe fine-tuning dataset consisted of 56MB of dialogue data gathered from multiple sources, which includes both real _and_ partially machine-generated conversations.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nModel weights were initialized from the `uft-6b` ConvoGPT model made available in [this commit](https://huggingface.co/hakurei/convogpt/tree/41b67bfddb6cd97070ffddf708e9720c9cb8d224/6b-uft).\n\nThe model was then further fine-tuned on ~48.5 million tokens for ~5k steps on 4 NVIDIA A40s using DeepSpeed.\n\n## Intended use\n\n### The easy way\n\nWe provide a notebook with a Gradio UI for playing around with the model without having to manually format inputs. This notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/PygmalionAI/gradio-ui/blob/master/notebooks/GPU.ipynb).\n\n### The manual way\n\nThe model can be used as a regular text generation model, but it'll perform best if the input prompt adheres to the following format:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]'s Persona: [A few sentences about the character you want the model to play]\n<START>\n[DIALOGUE HISTORY]\nYou: [Your input message here]\n[CHARACTER]:\n```\n\nWhere `[CHARACTER]` is, as you can probably guess, the name of the character you want the model to portray, `<START>` should be used verbatim as a delimiter token to separate persona and scenario data from the dialogue, and `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` is chat history so the model can have some conversational context to draw from. Ideally it'll be pairs of messages like:\n\n```\n[CHARACTER]: [some dialogue here]\nYou: [your response to the dialogue above]\n```\n\nApart from chat history, you can also just add example conversations in `[DIALOGUE HISTORY]` to show how the character should speak - ideally at the beginning, so it doesn't get confused as to what's conversation history vs. character definition.\n\n## Known issues\n\nWe haven't played around with the model enough to enumerate them. Feel free to give us some feedback!\n", "size_bytes": 12219206136, "downloads": 235418}
