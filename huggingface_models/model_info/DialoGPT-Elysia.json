{"pretrained_model_name": "Jaszii/DialoGPT-Elysia", "description": "---\ntags:\n- conversational\n---\n# DialoGPT-Elysia\n![Elysia](Elysia.png)\n\nThis is a fine-tuned version of the DialoGPT-medium model trained on the dialogues of Elysia from the Elysian Archives chapter of the popular video game Honkai Impact. (Elysian archives)\n\nThis fine-tuned version of the model has been trained specifically on a dataset of dialogues featuring Elysia from the Elysian Archives chapter, and as such, it has a better understanding of her character and is able to generate responses that are more in line with her personality and behavior as portrayed in this specific chapter of the game.\n\nTo use this model, you will need to provide it with a prompt in the form of a conversation context or a specific question. The model will then generate a response based on the provided prompt and its understanding of Elysia's character in the Elysian Archives chapter.\n\nHere is an example of how you might use the model:\n|Role | Response |\n|---------|--------|\n|User | Hey Elysia, how are you doing today? |\n|Elysia | Doing well, thanks for asking. What about you? |\n|User | I'm good. |\n|Elysia | That\u2019s good. I thought you\u2019d let it go at that. |\n\n|Role | Response |\n|---------|--------|\n|User | I heard that you are a skilled fighter, is that true? |\n|Elysia | If I had to be ranked, I guess I would be first in command. |\n\nPlease note that while this model is able to generate responses that are in line with Elysia's character, it is not able to provide any actual gameplay-related information or assistance. It is intended solely for generating text based on its understanding of Elysia's character.", "size_bytes": "1444564637", "downloads": 19}
