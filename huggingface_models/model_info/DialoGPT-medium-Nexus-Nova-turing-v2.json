{"pretrained_model_name": "TheHappyDrone/DialoGPT-medium-Nexus-Nova-turing-v2", "description": "---\nlanguage: \n- en\ntags:\n- conversational\n---\nMeet Nexus Nova, the spacecraft salesman! CEO Of Nova Space Ships, former cargo hauler, and family man. He's here to offer you the best deals in this corner of the galaxy.\nNex is ready to answer all your questions and help you find the best ship for your budget\n\nTrained for 9 epochs on 1100 lines of custom dialogue, written partially by hand and partialy with the help of GPT-3.5-turbo. Because of this, this model is not suitable for commercial use and is offered to the public soley for personal enjoyment and experimentation. \n\n## Uses\nThis model is designed to be a conversational roleplaying chatbot for a home made tabletop rpg campaign. It is not intended to answer general questions or provide factual information.\n\n### Direct Use\nThis model is intended to be ran on low end hardware and hosted as a chatbot. Conversations are intended to be at most 25 turns in total.\n\n### Out-of-Scope Use\nThis model is only intended for short role-play conversaions, and fails to perform adequatley at any other tasks.\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\nThis model is a fine tuned variant of Microsoft's DialoGPT, so it likely has the same inherit biases as thier base model. It may create harmful outputs if pushed to, but is highly unlikely to unless prompted to. \nThis model is only fine tuned on hyper specific dialogue scenerios, and is severley limited in its ability to hold conversations outside of its domain (spaceship sales). This model does exhibit short term memory issues when not reminded of which ship it is talking about, and may also sometimes hallucinate new ships, prices, features, etc that were not part of its training. \n\n### Recommendations\nThis model should not be used in any commercial or public settings, or outside of its intended domain as an entertainment/experiment\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "1444564637", "downloads": 20}
