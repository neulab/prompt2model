USE [openchatgpt-neox-125m](https://huggingface.co/mrsteyk/openchatgpt-neox-125m) INSTEAD !!!\n\n# --- Archived ---\n\n# openchatgpt-neo-r1\n\nThis model is a fine-tuned version of [EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M) on the openchatgpt safe-r1 dataset.\nIt achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 3.2156\n- Accuracy: 0.8338\n\n## Model description\n\nFinetune based on the inner workings of ChatGPT. I won't elaborate on that. You must have a faint idea of how prompt is made for it to spit anything that's not garbled mess.\n\nThis is effectively a schizophrenic idea that met the light of day. Practically a collab of 3 students in a virtual shed.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nIntended uses & limitations fall in line with OpenAI's. Dataset used consists of safe texts (i.e. not highly sexual/erotica type stuff). NSFW version of the dataset is not planned to exist at the moment.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a 125m version of GPT-Neo. My 1050Ti Mobile couldn't even handle that without gradient thingmabobs. If anyone knows how to effectively finetune larger models on free colabs - feel free to let me know. Pile tokenizer also has one downside compared to native GPT-2/3 - `Assistant`.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nData was split in ratio of 95%/5%. Preproccess included removing mentions of OpenAI wherever it was not deemed appropriete (GPT-2 has one of the appropriete mentions). Whole dataset consists of just shy off 3k input-output pairs. One input has multiple outputs (read as: one message has multiple variants of an answer). <<<1% (3 total) are curated lines (i.e. a huge mistake was spotted that needed corrections).\n\nHeavy bias on IT.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nInput and output were straight up concatenated due to the nature of how ChatGPT works. Padding chosen was the same as the separator token, if that's not effective - please let me know as I am new to this stuff.\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 2\n- eval_batch_size: 2\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 100\n- num_epochs: 5\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Accuracy |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:--------:|\n| 4.9203        | 1.0   | 1378 | 5.1668          | 0.7274   |\n| 4.1368        | 2.0   | 2756 | 4.3841          | 0.7563   |\n| 3.4554        | 3.0   | 4134 | 3.8068          | 0.7875   |\n| 2.7598        | 4.0   | 5512 | 3.3097          | 0.8303   |\n| 2.5879        | 5.0   | 6890 | 3.2156          | 0.8338   |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.25.1\n- Pytorch 1.13.0+cu116\n- Datasets 2.8.0\n- Tokenizers 0.13.2\n", "size_bytes": "551189869", "downloads": 4}
