The annotated fiction dataset has prepended tags to assist in generating towards a particular style. Here is an example prompt that shows how to use the annotations.\n\n```\n[ Title: The Dunwich Horror; Author: H. P. Lovecraft; Genre: Horror; Tags: 3rdperson, scary; Style: Dark ]\n***\nWhen a traveler in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork...\n```\n\nThe annotations can be mixed and matched to help generate towards a specific style.\n\n## Downstream Uses\n\nThis model can be used for entertainment purposes and as a creative writing assistant for fiction writers. The small size of the model can also help for easy debugging or further development of other models with a similar purpose.\n\n## Example Code\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('hakurei/lit-125M')\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('hakurei/lit-125M')\n\nprompt = '''[ Title: The Dunwich Horror; Author: H. P. Lovecraft; Genre: Horror ]\n***\nWhen a traveler'''\n\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model.generate(input_ids, do_sample=True, temperature=1.0, top_p=0.9, repetition_penalty=1.2, max_length=len(input_ids[0])+100, pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)\n\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0])\nprint(generated_text)\n```\n\nAn example output from this code produces a result that will look similar to:\n\n```\n[ Title: The Dunwich Horror; Author: H. P. Lovecraft; Genre: Horror ]\n***\nWhen a traveler takes a trip through the streets of the world, the traveler feels like a youkai with a whole world inside her mind. It can be very scary for a youkai. When someone goes in the opposite direction and knocks on your door, it is actually the first time you have ever come to investigate something like that.\nThat's right: everyone has heard stories about youkai, right? If you have heard them, you know what I'm talking about. \nIt's hard not to say you\n```\n\n## Team members and Acknowledgements\n\n- [Anthony Mercurio](https://github.com/harubaru)\n- Imperishable_NEET", "size_bytes": "551195025", "downloads": 100}
