The resulting model was then **further fine-tuned** on the [Daily Dialogues](http://yanran.li/dailydialog) for 40k steps, with **34**/36 layers frozen.\n\n\nDesigned for use with [ai-msgbot](https://github.com/pszemraj/ai-msgbot) to create an open-ended chatbot (of course, if other use cases arise, have at it).\n\n\n## conversation data\n\nThe dataset was tokenized and fed to the model as a conversation between two speakers, whose names are below. This is relevant for writing prompts and filtering/extracting text from responses.\n\n`script_speaker_name` = `person alpha`\n\n`script_responder_name` = `person beta`\n\n## examples\n\n- the default inference API examples should work _okay_\n- an ideal test would be explicitly adding `person beta` into the prompt text the model is forced to respond to instead of adding onto the entered prompt.\n\n\n## citations \n```\n@inproceedings{dinan2019wizard,\n  author={Emily Dinan and Stephen Roller and Kurt Shuster and Angela Fan and Michael Auli and Jason Weston},\n  title={{W}izard of {W}ikipedia: Knowledge-powered Conversational Agents},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)},\n  year={2019},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{li-etal-2017-dailydialog,\n    title = \"{D}aily{D}ialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-turn Dialogue Dataset\",\n    author = \"Li, Yanran  and\n      Su, Hui  and\n      Shen, Xiaoyu  and\n      Li, Wenjie  and\n      Cao, Ziqiang  and\n      Niu, Shuzi\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)\",\n    month = nov,\n    year = \"2017\",\n    address = \"Taipei, Taiwan\",\n    publisher = \"Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/I17-1099\",\n    pages = \"986--995\",\n    abstract = \"We develop a high-quality multi-turn dialog dataset, \\textbf{DailyDialog}, which is intriguing in several aspects. The language is human-written and less noisy. The dialogues in the dataset reflect our daily communication way and cover various topics about our daily life.

Then, we evaluate existing approaches on DailyDialog dataset and hope it benefit the research field of dialog systems.
