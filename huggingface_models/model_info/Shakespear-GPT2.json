Consider that because it comes from plays, such a typographical structure might be reproduced.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nTrained with Shakespeare's plays corpus.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 1\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 2.0\n\n### Training results\n\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.16.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.10.0+cu111\n- Datasets 1.18.0\n- Tokenizers 0.11.0\n", "size_bytes": "510401385", "downloads": 1141}
