{"pretrained_model_name": "RajaSi/sd-prompt-generator-gpt-neo-gn", "description": "hey friends welcome  in this applied NLP tutorial we're going to learn how to fine tune a text generation model one second how to push the text generated like the fine-tuned model into hugging face model Hub and in this process we are also going to explore the stable diffusion part of it so this is a combination of a lot of different things.\n the model is uploaded to hugging face model Hub and the model I'm calling it SD prompt generator GPT Neo because this is a prompt generator for stable diffusion so if you want to create something using stable division the AI are generated so you ideally need to give a very detailed prompt.\n ideally is as you can see from the name it says SD prompt generator GPT Neo so we're going to use GPT Neo model to fine tune our prompts so that we have created a text generation model where we can give a prompt text and that will generate new prompt or a new extended prompt better prompt for us so what are we going to do we are going to take a set of existing stable diffusion prompts and we have got a 124 in 124 million stay GPT Neo model and we are going to fine tune that model based on this data and then we are going to finally save that model and then push the model into hugging phase model Hub", "size_bytes": "551182545", "downloads": 7}
