As Sinhala is one of those low resource languages, there are only a handful of models been trained. So, this would be a great place to start training for more downstream tasks.\n\nThis model uses a manually cleaned version of MC4 dataset which can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/keshan/clean-si-mc4). Although the dataset is relatively small ~3GB. The finetuned model on [news articles](https://huggingface.co/keshan/sinhala-gpt2-newswire) generates good and acceptable results. \n\n## Model Specification\n\n\nThe model chosen for training is GPT2 with the following specifications:\n 1. vocab_size=50257\n 2. n_embd=768\n 3. n_head=12\n 4. n_layer=12\n 5. n_positions=1024\n \n## How to Use\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for causal language modeling:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import pipeline\ngenerator = pipeline('text-generation', model='flax-community/Sinhala-gpt2')\ngenerator(\"\u0db8\u0db8\", max_length=50, num_return_sequences=5)\n```\n", "size_bytes": "510397417", "downloads": 14}
