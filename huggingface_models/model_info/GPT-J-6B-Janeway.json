The dataset is based on the same dataset used by GPT-Neo-2.7B-Picard, with 20% more data in various genres.\nSome parts of the dataset have been prepended using the following text: `[Genre: <genre1>,<genre2>]`\n### How to use\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='KoboldAI/GPT-J-6B-Janeway')\n>>> generator(\"Welcome Captain Janeway, I apologize for the delay.\", do_sample=True, min_length=50)\n[{'generated_text': 'Welcome Captain Janeway, I apologize for the delay.\"\\nIt's all right,\" Janeway said. \"I'm certain that you're doing your best to keep me informed of what\\'s going on.\"'}]\n```\n### Limitations and Biases\n\nThe core functionality of GPT-J is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work. When prompting GPT-J it is important to remember that the statistically most likely next token is often not the token that produces the most \"accurate\" text. Never depend upon GPT-J to produce factually accurate output.\n\nGPT-J was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. Depending upon use case GPT-J may produce socially unacceptable text. See [Sections 5 and 6 of the Pile paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) for a more detailed analysis of the biases in the Pile.\n\nAs with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how GPT-J will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\nThe model uses the following model as base:\n```bibtex\n@misc{gpt-j,\n  author = {Wang, Ben and Komatsuzaki, Aran},\n  title = {{GPT-J-6B: A 6 Billion Parameter Autoregressive Language Model}},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax}},\n  year = 2021,\n  month = May\n}\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis project would not have been possible without compute generously provided by Google through the\n[TPU Research Cloud](https://sites.research.google/trc/), as well as the Cloud TPU team for providing early access to the [Cloud TPU VM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-cloud-tpu-vms) Alpha.\n", "size_bytes": "12106053103", "downloads": 1998}
