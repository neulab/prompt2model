The model was originally the pre-trained [GPT2 Small Indonesian](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/gpt2-small-indonesian) model, which was then fine-tuned on Indonesian kids' stories from [Room To Read](https://literacycloud.org/) and [Let's Read](https://reader.letsreadasia.org/).\n\n10% of the dataset was kept for evaluation purposes. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned and achieved an evaluation loss of 3.777 and an evaluation perplexity of 43.68.\n\nHugging Face's `Trainer` class from the [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers) library was used to train the model. PyTorch was used as the backend framework during training, but the model remains compatible with other frameworks nonetheless.\n\n## Model\n\n| Model                          | #params | Arch.      | Training/Validation data (text)   |\n| ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |\n| `gpt2-indo-small-kids-stories` | 124M    | GPT2 Small | Indonesian Kids' Stories (860 KB) |\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nThe model was fine-tuned for 10 epochs.\n\n| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss |\n| ----- | ------------- | --------------- |\n| 1     | 4.259600      | 4.020201        |\n| 2     | 3.979100      | 3.911295        |\n| 3     | 3.818300      | 3.849313        |\n| 4     | 3.691600      | 3.809931        |\n| 5     | 3.589300      | 3.789201        |\n| 6     | 3.506200      | 3.778665        |\n| 7     | 3.439200      | 3.774871        |\n| 8     | 3.387600      | 3.774859        |\n| 9     | 3.351300      | 3.776672        |\n| 10    | 3.330100      | 3.776935        |\n\n## How to Use (PyTorch)\n\n### As Causal Language Model\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npretrained_name = \"bookbot/gpt2-indo-small-kids-stories\"\n\nnlp = pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=pretrained_name,\n    tokenizer=pretrained_name\n)\n\nnlp(\"Archie sedang mengendarai roket ke planet Mars.\")\n```\n\n### Feature Extraction in PyTorch\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2TokenizerFast\n\npretrained_name = \"bookbot/gpt2-indo-small-kids-stories\"\nmodel = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(pretrained_name)\ntokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained(pretrained_name)\n\nprompt = \"Archie sedang mengendarai roket ke planet Mars.\"\nencoded_input = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')\noutput = model(**encoded_input)\n```\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nDo consider the biases which come from both the pre-trained GPT-2 model and the Indonesian Kids' Stories dataset that may be carried over into the results of this model.\n\n## Author\n\nGPT-2 Indonesian Small Kids Stories was trained and evaluated by [Wilson Wongso](https://w11wo.github.io/).
