This model is meant to be used only for research and educational purposes.\n\n## Training data\nThe training data is composed of Italian psychology articles. \nFine-tuning was performed on this dataset to adapt the base OPT-350m model to the specific topic of psychology and mental health in Italian language.", "size_bytes": "1324911837", "downloads": 0}
