The dataset was compiled from all texts of https://www.feinschwarz.net (as of October 2021). The homepage gathers essayistic texts on theological topics.\n\nThe model will be used to explore the challenges of text-generating AI for theology with a hands on approach. Can an AI generate theological knowledge? Is a text by Karl Rahner of more value than an AI-generated text? Can we even distinguish a Rahner text from an AI-generated text in the future? And the crucial question: Would it be bad if not?\n\nThe model is a very first attempt and in its current version certainly not yet a danger for academic theology \ud83e\udd13 \n\n# Using the model\n\nYou can create text with the model using this code:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline('text-generation', model=\"Michael711/feinschwarz\",\n                 tokenizer=\"Michael711/feinschwarz\")\n\ntext = pipe(\"Der Sinn des Lebens ist es\", max_length=100)[0][\"generated_text\"]\n\nprint(text)\n```\n\nHave fun theologizing!", "size_bytes": "510431465", "downloads": 0}
