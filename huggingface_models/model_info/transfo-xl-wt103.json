This model also uses adaptive softmax inputs and outputs (tied).\n- **Developed by:** [Zihang Dai](dzihang@cs.cmu.edu), [Zhilin Yang](zhiliny@cs.cmu.edu), [Yiming Yang1](yiming@cs.cmu.edu), [Jaime Carbonell](jgc@cs.cmu.edu), [Quoc V.

In addition, the model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.\n\n## Risks, Limitations and Biases\n**CONTENT WARNING: Readers should be aware this section contains content that is disturbing, offensive, and can propagate historical and current stereotypes.**\n\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)).\n\n\n## Training\n\n\n#### Training Data\n\nThe authors provide additionally notes about the vocabulary used, in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02860.pdf): \n\n> best model trained the Wikitext-103 dataset. We seed the our Transformer-XL with a context of at most 512 consecutive tokens randomly sampled from the test set of Wikitext-103. Then, we run Transformer-XL to generate a pre-defined number of tokens (500 or 1,000 in our case). For each generation step, we first find the top-40 probabilities of the next-step distribution and sample from top-40 tokens based on the re-normalized distribution. To help reading, we detokenize the context, the generated text and the reference text.\n\nThe authors use the following pretraining corpora for the model, described in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02860.pdf):\n- WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016), \n\n\n#### Training Procedure\n\n##### Preprocessing\nThe authors provide additionally notes about the training procedure used, in the [associated paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02860.pdf): \n\n> Similar to but different from enwik8, text8 con- tains 100M processed Wikipedia characters cre- ated by lowering case the text and removing any character other than the 26 letters a through z, and space. Due to the similarity, we simply adapt the best model and the same hyper-parameters on en- wik8 to text8 without further tuning.\n\n\n## Evaluation\n\n#### Results\n\n| Method               | enwiki8  |text8 | One Billion Word | WT-103 | PTB (w/o finetuning) | \n|:--------------------:|---------:|:----:|:----------------:|:------:|:--------------------:|\n| Transformer-XL.      | 0.99     | 1.08 | 21.8             | 18.3   |  54.5                |\n\n## Citation Information\n\n```bibtex\n\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1901.02860,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.1901.02860},\n  \n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860},\n  \n  author = {Dai, Zihang and Yang, Zhilin and Yang, Yiming and Carbonell, Jaime and Le, Quoc V. and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan},\n  \n  keywords = {Machine Learning (cs.LG), Computation and Language (cs.CL), Machine Learning (stat.ML), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\n  \n  title = {Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context},\n  \n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  \n  year = {2019},\n  \n  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Share Alike 4.0 International}\n}\n\n\n```\n\n## How to Get Started With the Model\n```\nfrom transformers import TransfoXLTokenizer, TransfoXLModel\nimport torch\n\ntokenizer = TransfoXLTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"transfo-xl-wt103\")\nmodel = TransfoXLModel.from_pretrained(\"transfo-xl-wt103\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "1140884800", "downloads": 18235}
