The model\ndimension is split into 16 heads, each with a dimension of 256. Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is applied to 64\ndimensions of each head. The model is trained with a tokenization vocabulary of 50257, using the same set of BPEs as\nGPT-2/GPT-3.\n\n## Training data\n\nNB-GPT-J-6B was finetuned on [NCC](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NbAiLab/NCC), the Norwegian Colossal Corpus, plus other Internet sources like Wikipedia, mC4, and OSCAR.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nThis model was finetuned for 130 billion tokens over 1,000,000 steps on a TPU v3-8 VM. It was trained as an autoregressive language model, using cross-entropy loss to maximize the likelihood of predicting the next token correctly.\n\n## Intended Use and Limitations\n\nNB-GPT-J-6B learns an inner representation of the Norwegian language that can be used to extract features useful for downstream tasks. The model is best at what it was pretrained for however, which is generating text from a prompt.\n\n### How to use\n\nThis model can be easily loaded using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` functionality:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"NbAiLab/nb-gpt-j-6B\")\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"NbAiLab/nb-gpt-j-6B\")\n```\n\n### Limitations and Biases\n\nAs the original GPT-J model, the core functionality of NB-GPT-J-6B is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work. When prompting NB-GPT-J-6B it is important to remember that the statistically most likely next token is often not the token that produces the most \"accurate\" text. Never depend upon NB-GPT-J-6B to produce factually accurate output.\n\nThe original GPT-J was trained on the Pile, a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. Depending upon use case GPT-J may produce socially unacceptable text. See [Sections 5 and 6 of the Pile paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027) for a more detailed analysis of the biases in the Pile. A fine-grained analysis of the bias contained in the corpus used for fine-tuning is still pending.\n\nAs with all language models, it is hard to predict in advance how NB-GPT-J-6B will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWe still have to find proper datasets to evaluate the model, so help is welcome!\n\n## Citation and Related Information\n\n### BibTeX entry\n\nTo cite this model or the corpus used:\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{kummervold2021operationalizing,\n  title={Operationalizing a National Digital Library: The Case for a Norwegian Transformer Model},\n  author={Kummervold, Per E and De la Rosa, Javier and Wetjen, Freddy and Brygfjeld, Svein Arne},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 23rd Nordic Conference on Computational Linguistics (NoDaLiDa)},\n  pages={20--29},\n  year={2021},\n  url={https://aclanthology.org/2021.nodalida-main.3/}\n}\n```\n\nIf you use this model, we would love to hear about it!
