Compared to GPT-Neo-2.7-Horni, this model is much heavier on the sexual content.\n\n**Warning: THIS model is NOT suitable for use by minors. The model will output X-rated content.**\n## Training data\nThe training data contains user-generated stories from sexstories.com. All stories are tagged using the following way:\n```\n[Theme: <theme1>, <theme2> ,<theme3>]\n<Story goes here>\n```\n### How to use\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation. This example generates a different sequence each time it's run:\n```py\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model='KoboldAI/GPT-Neo-2.7B-Shinen')\n>>> generator(\"She was staring at me\", do_sample=True, min_length=50)\n[{'generated_text': 'She was staring at me with a look that said it all. She wanted me so badly tonight that I wanted'}]\n```\n### Limitations and Biases\nGPT-Neo was trained as an autoregressive language model. This means that its core functionality is taking a string of text and predicting the next token. While language models are widely used for tasks other than this, there are a lot of unknowns with this work.\nGPT-Neo-Shinen was trained on a dataset known to contain profanity, lewd, and otherwise abrasive language. GPT-Neo-Shinen *WILL* produce socially unacceptable text without warning.\nGPT-Neo-Shinen will respond to particular prompts and offensive content may occur without warning. We recommend having a human curate or filter the outputs before releasing them, both to censor undesirable content and to improve the quality of the results.\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\nThe model is made using the following software:\n```bibtex\n@software{gpt-neo,\n  author       = {Black, Sid and\n                  Leo, Gao and\n                  Wang, Phil and\n                  Leahy, Connor and\n                  Biderman, Stella},\n  title        = {{GPT-Neo: Large Scale Autoregressive Language \n                   Modeling with Mesh-Tensorflow}},\n  month        = mar,\n  year         = 2021,\n  note         = {{If you use this software, please cite it using \n                   these metadata.}},\n  publisher    = {Zenodo},\n  version      = {1.0},\n  doi          = {10.5281/zenodo.5297715},\n  url          = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5297715}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "5369795578", "downloads": 10509}
