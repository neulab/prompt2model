{"pretrained_model_name": "cambridgeltl/simctg_wikitext103", "description": "This model provides a GPT-2 language model trained with SimCTG on the Wikitext-103 benchmark [(Merity et al., 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07843) based on our paper [_A Contrastive Framework for Neural Text Generation_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417).\n\nWe provide a detailed tutorial on how to apply SimCTG and Contrastive Search in our [project repo](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG#4-huggingface-style-tutorials-back-to-top). In the following, we illustrate a brief tutorial on how to use our approach to perform text generation.\n\n## 1. Installation of SimCTG:\n```yaml\npip install simctg --upgrade\n```\n\n## 2. Initialize SimCTG Model:\n```python\nimport torch\n# load SimCTG language model\nfrom simctg.simctggpt import SimCTGGPT\nmodel_name = r'cambridgeltl/simctg_wikitext103'\nmodel = SimCTGGPT(model_name)\nmodel.eval()\ntokenizer = model.tokenizer\n```\n\n## 3. Prepare the Text Prefix:\n```python\nprefix_text = r\"Butt criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . \nBuchanan also criticized the controls , calling\"\nprint ('Prefix is: {}'.format(prefix_text))\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(prefix_text)\ninput_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)\ninput_ids = torch.LongTensor(input_ids).view(1,-1)\n```\n\n## 4. Generate Text with Contrastive Search:\n```python\nbeam_width, alpha, decoding_len = 8, 0.6, 128\noutput = model.fast_contrastive_search(input_ids=input_ids, beam_width=beam_width, \n                                       alpha=alpha, decoding_len=decoding_len)    \n                                           \nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output))\n'''\n  Prefix is: Butt criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . \n             Buchanan also criticized the controls , calling\n  Output:\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Butt criticized Donald's controls in certain situations in the game, as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles. Buchanan also \n  criticized the controls, calling them \" unimpressive \" and a \" nightmare \" of an experience to play with players unfamiliar with Tetris. \n  On the other hand, his opinion was shared by other reviewers, and some were critical of the game's technical design for the Wii version \n  of Tetris. In addition, Tintin's review included a quote from Roger Ebert, who said that Tetris was better than the original game due to \n  its simplicity and ease of play. Ebert's comments were included in the game's DVD commentary, released on March 22, 2010. It is unclear \n  if any of the video commentary was taken from the DVD\n'''\n```\n\nFor more details of our work, please refer to our main [project repo](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG).\n\n## 5.
