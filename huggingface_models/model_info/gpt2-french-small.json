All the fine-tuning fastai v2 techniques were used.\n\nIt is now available on Hugging Face. For further information or requests, please go to \"Faster than training from scratch \u2014 Fine-tuning the English GPT-2 in any language with Hugging Face and fastai v2 (practical case with Portuguese)\".\n\nModel migth be improved by using larger dataset under larger powerful training infrastructure. At least this one can be used for small finetuning experimentation (i.e with aitextgen).\n\nPS : I've lost the metrics but it speaks french with some minor grammar issues, coherence of text is somehow limited.
