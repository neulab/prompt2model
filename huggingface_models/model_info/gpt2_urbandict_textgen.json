Pad token should be set to the EOS token.\nInputs should be of the form \"define <your word>: \".\n\n## Training Data\nAll training data was obtained from [Urban Dictionary Words And Definitions on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/urban-dictionary-words-dataset). Data was additionally filtered, normalized, and spell-checked.\n\n## Bias\nThis model was trained on public internet data and will almost definitely produce offensive results. Some efforts were made to reduce this (i.e definitions with ethnic / gender-based slurs were removed), but the final model should not be trusted to produce non-offensive definitions.", "size_bytes": "510401385", "downloads": 0}
