GPT-2 is trained with a simple objective: predict the next word, given all of the previous words within some text. The diversity of the dataset causes this simple goal to contain naturally occurring demonstrations of many tasks across diverse domains. GPT-2 is a direct scale-up of GPT, with more than 10X the parameters and trained on more than 10X the amount of data.\n\n### Live Demo\nFor testing model with special configuration, please visit [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HamidRezaAttar/gpt2-home)\n\n### Blog Post\nFor more detailed information about project development please refer to my [blog post](https://hamidrezaattar.github.io/blog/markdown/2022/02/17/gpt2-home.html).\n\n### How to use\nFor best experience and clean outputs, you can use Live Demo mentioned above, also you can use the notebook mentioned in my [GitHub](https://github.com/HamidRezaAttar/GPT2-Home)\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for text generation.\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, pipeline\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"HamidRezaAttar/gpt2-product-description-generator\")\n>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"HamidRezaAttar/gpt2-product-description-generator\")\n>>> generator = pipeline('text-generation', model, tokenizer=tokenizer, config={'max_length':100})\n>>> generated_text = generator(\"This bed is very comfortable.\")\n```\n\n### Citation info\n```bibtex\n@misc{GPT2-Home,\n  author = {HamidReza Fatollah Zadeh Attar},\n  title = {GPT2-Home the English home product description generator},\n  year = {2021},\n  publisher = {GitHub},\n  journal = {GitHub repository},\n  howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/HamidRezaAttar/GPT2-Home}},\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "510403817", "downloads": 242}
