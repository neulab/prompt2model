If you want non-garbage outputs, these need to be specified manually:\n\n```\nperson alpha:\nhi! what are your hobbies?\n```\n\nthen model will respond, ideally with person beta: \"response text\"\n\n---\n\n- the default inference API examples should work _okay_\n- an ideal test would be explicitly adding `person beta` to the **end** of the prompt text. The model is forced to respond to the entered chat prompt instead of adding to the entered prompt and then responding to that (which may cut off the response text due to the Inference API limits).\n## citations \n```\n@inproceedings{dinan2019wizard,\n  author={Emily Dinan and Stephen Roller and Kurt Shuster and Angela Fan and Michael Auli and Jason Weston},\n  title={{W}izard of {W}ikipedia: Knowledge-powered Conversational Agents},\n  booktitle = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)},\n  year={2019},\n}\n\n@inproceedings{li-etal-2017-dailydialog,\n    title = \"{D}aily{D}ialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-turn Dialogue Dataset\",\n    author = \"Li, Yanran  and\n      Su, Hui  and\n      Shen, Xiaoyu  and\n      Li, Wenjie  and\n      Cao, Ziqiang  and\n      Niu, Shuzi\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Eighth International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)\",\n    month = nov,\n    year = \"2017\",\n    address = \"Taipei, Taiwan\",\n    publisher = \"Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/I17-1099\",\n    pages = \"986--995\",\n    abstract = \"We develop a high-quality multi-turn dialog dataset, \\textbf{DailyDialog}, which is intriguing in several aspects. The language is human-written and less noisy. The dialogues in the dataset reflect our daily communication way and cover various topics about our daily life. We also manually label the developed dataset with communication intention and emotion information. Then, we evaluate existing approaches on DailyDialog dataset and hope it benefit the research field of dialog systems.
