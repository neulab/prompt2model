{"pretrained_model_name": "cambridgeltl/simctg_english_wikipedia", "description": "This model provides a GPT-2 language model trained with SimCTG on the English Wikipedia based on our paper [_A Contrastive Framework for Neural Text Generation_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06417).\n\nWe provide a detailed tutorial on how to apply SimCTG and Contrastive Search in our [project repo](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG#4-huggingface-style-tutorials-back-to-top). In the following, we illustrate a brief tutorial on how to use our approach to perform text generation.\n\n## 1. Installation of SimCTG:\n```yaml\npip install simctg --upgrade\n```\n\n## 2. Initialize SimCTG Model:\n```python\nimport torch\n# load SimCTG language model\nfrom simctg.simctggpt import SimCTGGPT\nmodel_name = r'cambridgeltl/simctg_english_wikipedia'\nmodel = SimCTGGPT(model_name)\nmodel.eval()\ntokenizer = model.tokenizer\n```\n\n## 3. Prepare the Text Prefix:\n```python\nprefix_text = r\"Insect farming is the practice of raising and breeding insects as livestock, also referred to as minilivestock or micro stock. Insects may be farmed for the commodities\"\nprint ('Prefix is: {}'.format(prefix_text))\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(prefix_text)\ninput_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)\ninput_ids = torch.LongTensor(input_ids).view(1,-1)\n```\n\n## 4. Generate Text with Contrastive Search:\n```python\nbeam_width, alpha, decoding_len = 5, 0.6, 128\noutput = model.fast_contrastive_search(input_ids=input_ids, beam_width=beam_width, \n                                       alpha=alpha, decoding_len=decoding_len) \nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output))\n'''\n  Prefix is: Insect farming is the practice of raising and breeding insects as livestock, also referred to as minilivestock or \n             micro stock. Insects may be farmed for the commodities\n  Output:\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Insect farming is the practice of raising and breeding insects as livestock, also referred to as minilivestock or micro stock. \n  Insects may be farmed for the commodities they produce, such as honey, corn, sorghum, and other crops. In some cases, the \n  production of insects is a way to increase income for the owner or his family. This type of farming has been described as \"an \n  economic system that benefits all people regardless of race, sex, or social status\" (p. 9). A large number of farmers in North \n  America, Europe, and South America have used the method of farming for food production in order to feed their families and livestock. \n  The most common method of farming is by hand-cropping, which consists of cutting a hole in the ground and using a saw\n'''\n```\n\nFor more details of our work, please refer to our main [project repo](https://github.com/yxuansu/SimCTG).\n\n## 5.
