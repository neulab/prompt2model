Please note that, among other restrictions, this license forbids use of the model (or derivatives thereof)\n\"To provide medical advice and medical results interpretation.\" If you are concerned that your use case would follow under the \"letter\" of this restriction, but not the \"spirit,\" you can contact us to discuss.\n\n## Direct Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\nIt is possible to use this model to generate text, which is useful for experimentation and understanding its capabilities. It should not be directly used for production or work that may directly impact people.\n\n## Downstream Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->\nThe main way we have used this model is finetuning for downstream question answering tasks, and we recommend using this model that way.\n \n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\n<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->\nWe do not recommend using this model for natural language generation in a production environment, finetuned or otherwise.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->\nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Weidinger et al. (2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.04359.pdf)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->\nWhile this model is capable of generating natural language text, we have only begun to explore this capability and its limitations. Understanding these limitations is especially important in a domain like medicine. Therefore, **we strongly recommend against using this model in production for natural language generation.**\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\n<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->\n\nThis model was trained on the Pubmed Abstracts and Full Text from [The Pile](https://pile.eleuther.ai/). \n\n## Training Procedure\n\n<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications. Content here should link to that section when it is relevant to the training procedure. -->\n\nThe model was trained on [MosaicML Cloud](https://www.mosaicml.com/cloud), a platform designed for large workloads like LLMs. Using the [Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer) training library and [PyTorch FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html), it was easy to enable multi-node training across 128 A100-40GB GPUs, and the total run was completed in ~6.25 days. The model was trained with batch size=1024 and sequence length=1024 for 300B tokens using Decoupled AdamW with the following settings:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | ------ |\n| lr  | 1.6e-4 |\n| eps | 1e-8       |\n| betas | \\[0.9, 0.95\\]      |\n| weight decay    |  1.6e-5      |\n\nThe training process was very smooth and did not suffer from any divergences.\n\nAs we were preparing the training run, we were unsure of the benefits of training out to 300B tokens for language model perplexity and downstream task performance. While most models of this scale (e.g. GPT Neo 2.7B) are trained to 300-400B tokens, the datasets those models use are vastly larger than PubMed. For instance, The Pile is 8x the size of its PubMed subcorpora.\n  \nFortunately, we did continue to see steady perplexity improvements on the validation and training sets for the entirety of training, and preliminary experiments showed improved downstream task performance as we trained out to the full 300B tokens. Our takeaway from this was that it was indeed worth it to train for the full 300B tokens, even though this represented dramatically more passes through the data than comparable models.\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe model uses a custom tokenizer trained on the PubMed Abstracts. When building domain specific models we have found it important to use a tokenizer trained on in-domain text to maximize performance on downstream tasks. A key benefit is that common biomedical terms are represented as entire tokens. \n\nFor instance, all of these following terms are tokenized into single tokens by the biomedical tokenizer and multiple tokens by the standard GPT-2 tokenizer:\n  \n|   |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| chromatography |   chrom/atography |\n| cytotoxicity |   cyt/ot/oxicity |\n| Immunohistochemistry |   Immun/oh/ist/ochemistry |\n| photosynthesis |   photos/ynthesis |\n| probiotic |   prob/iotic |\n\nThis allows the model to encode information about these concepts in their individual token representations rather than spread out across subword tokens like \u201coh\u201d shared with many other terms.\n\n# Technical Specifications\n\n## Model Architecture and Objective\n\nBioMedLM 2.7B is a standard GPT-2 implementation (trained with Flash Attention) with the following hyperparameters:\n\n|             |       |\n| ----------- | ----- |\n| hidden size | 2560  |\n| heads       | 20    |\n| layers      | 32    |\n| vocab size  | 28896 |\n| sequence length| 1024      |\n\n## Compute Infrastructure\n\nThe model was trained on [MosaicML Cloud](https://www.mosaicml.com/cloud), a platform designed for large workloads like LLMs. Using the [Composer](https://github.com/mosaicml/composer) training library and [PyTorch FSDP](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html), it was easy to enable multi-node training across 128 A100-40GB GPUs, and the total run was completed in ~6.25 days.\n", "size_bytes": "10706653655", "downloads": 4835}
