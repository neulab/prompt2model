[Movielines](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/movie-dialog-corpus) The movie lines promote longer and more thought out responses but it can be very random. About 200k lines!\n 2. [Discord Messages](https://www.kaggle.com/jef1056/discord-data) The messages are on a wide variety of topics filtered and removed spam which makes the AI highly random but gives it a very random response to every days questions! about 120 million messages!\n 3. Custom dataset scrapped from my messages, These messages are very narrow teaching this dataset and sending a random reply will make the AI say sorry loads of time!\n    \n## Training\n The Discord Messages Dataset simply dwarfs the other datasets, Hence the data sets are repeated.\n This leads to them covering each others issues!\n  \n The AI has a context of 6 messages which means it will reply until the 4th message from user.\n [Example](https://huggingface.co/deepparag/Aeona-Beta/discussions/1)\n \n## Tips for Hugging Face interference\n    I recommend send the user input,\n    previous 3 AI and human responses.\n    \n    Using more context than this will lead to useless responses but using less is alright but the responses may be random.  \n## Evaluation \nBelow is a comparison of Aeona vs. other baselines on the mixed dataset given above using automatic evaluation metrics.\n\n| Model | Perplexity |\n|---|---|\n| Seq2seq Baseline [3] | 29.8 |\n| Wolf et al.
