(2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.\n\n \n## Recommendations\nThe model creators note in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy):\n>  **ISSUE : Wrong Filenames in the Dataset**\n We recently came to know about a bug which happened during the scraping of the dataset. We found out that the file names are obsolete/misleading.[Refer this [issue](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy/issues/71)] We thank Naman for pointing out the issue.\nThis might have two implications\n    - Since the filtering for the training dataset is done using the file extension, we might have had wrong datapoints in the dataset while training and we might have missed a lot of right datapoints that belong to the languages of choice. \n    \n# Training Details\n \n## Training Data\n The model creators note in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy):\n> For fine-tuning GPTNeo-125M on CodeClippy dataset we used AdamW optimizer (beta1=0.9, beta2=0.95) with GPT3-like learning rate schedule (4k warmup steps from 0 to 5e-5 followed by 50k cosine decay steps to 5e-6), weight decay 0.1 and batch size 1024, sequence length 2048. \n \n## Training Procedure\n \n \n### Preprocessing\n \nMore information needed\n \n### Speeds, Sizes, Times\n The model creators note in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy):\n> For fine-tuning GPTNeo-125M on CodeClippy dataset we used AdamW optimizer (beta1=0.9, beta2=0.95) with GPT3-like learning rate schedule (4k warmup steps from 0 to 5e-5 followed by 50k cosine decay steps to 5e-6), weight decay 0.1 and batch size 1024, sequence length 2048. The choice of relatively large batch size and low LR with long warmup are made to avoid agressive updates and preserve the knowledge contained in pretrained GPTNeo weights.\n \n# Evaluation\n \n \n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n \n### Testing Data\n \n \nThe model creators note in the GitHub Repo](https://github.com/CodedotAl/gpt-code-clippy):\n> The models are also evaluated on the [APPS](https://github.com/hendrycks/apps) and [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) datasets.\n \n\n \n \n \n### Factors\n \nMore information needed\n \n### Metrics\n \nMore information needed\n \n## Results \n \n| Model                             |   pass@1    |   pass@2    |   pass@5    |   pass@10   |\n| --------------------------------- | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |\n| gpt-neo-125M-apps                 |    0.06%    |    0.12%    |    0.30%    |    0.61%    |\n \n# Model Examination\n \nMore information needed\n \n# Environmental Impact\n \nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.
