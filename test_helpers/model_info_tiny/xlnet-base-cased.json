It was introduced in the paper [XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) by Yang et al. and first released in [this repository](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/). \n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing XLNet did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nXLNet is a new unsupervised language representation learning method based on a novel generalized permutation language modeling objective. Additionally, XLNet employs Transformer-XL as the backbone model, exhibiting excellent performance for language tasks involving long context. Overall, XLNet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on various downstream language tasks including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model is mostly intended to be fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=xlnet) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked) to make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text generation, you should look at models like GPT2.\n\n## Usage\n\nHere is how to use this model to get the features of a given text in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import XLNetTokenizer, XLNetModel\n\ntokenizer = XLNetTokenizer.from_pretrained('xlnet-base-cased')\nmodel = XLNetModel.from_pretrained('xlnet-base-cased')\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n```\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1906-08237,\n  author    = {Zhilin Yang and\n               Zihang Dai and\n               Yiming Yang and\n               Jaime G.
