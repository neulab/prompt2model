instruction: 'Temporal date expressions are commonly used to refer to specific time
  periods. Your task is to identify these temporal date expressions and provide the
  exact dates they refer to.


  For this task, the input is a string containing two specific elements: a posted
  date in the format "[Posted: YYYY-MM-DD]" and a sentence or statement that contains
  various temporal date references (e.g., early December, the end of the year, today,
  August, last Christmas, next Month, etc).


  Your program should output a string that maps the time period references mentioned
  in the input to their corresponding dates, following these strict rules:


  1. If temporal date references are found, the output should use either "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "YYYY-MM", or "YYYY" to represent the exact date.

  - If multiple time period references are found, separate them using ''|''.

  2. If no temporal date reference is found or the referred date is ambiguous, the
  output should just be ''N/A'', i.e., output="N/A".'
