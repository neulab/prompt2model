Prompts typically consist of two components: a task "instruction" and, optionally, a few "demonstrations" (examples to illustrate the task). I want to segment prompts into these two components. For each prompt, return a line starting with "1) Instruction: " and a line starting with "2) Demonstrations: ". If no demonstration is provided, write "NO DEMONSTRATION.". When demonstrations are provided, only include examples where the full input-output pair is given; ignore partial examples written with the intent of being completed by the AI language model. Otherwise, match the formatting, word selection, and punctuation used in the original prompt.
