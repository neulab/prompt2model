# Seed Generator

The `seed_generator` variable is an instance of the `ConstantSeedGenerator` class, which is used to generate a constant random seed. By default, it is initialized with a seed value of 2023.

You can access the random seed by calling the `get_seed` method on the `seed_generator` instance.

```python
seed = seed_generator.get_seed()
```

This provides a convenient way to set a consistent random seed throughout your code.

# ChatGPTAgent

The `ChatGPTAgent` class provides a convenient interface for accessing OpenAI's ChatCompletion API. It is initialized with an API key, which can be passed as a parameter to the class constructor. Alternatively, you can set the API key as an environment variable by using `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>`.

The `generate_openai_chat_completion` method of the `ChatGPTAgent` class is used to generate a chat completion using OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model. It takes a prompt as input and returns a response object.

```python
response = chat_gpt_agent.generate_openai_chat_completion(prompt)
```

The `response` object contains the generated response from the model.

## OPENAI_ERRORS

The `OPENAI_ERRORS` variable is a tuple that contains the types of errors that OpenAI's API or related operations may raise. It includes the following error types:

- `openai.error.APIError`: Represents an error returned by the OpenAI API.
- `openai.error.Timeout`: Represents a timeout error.
- `openai.error.RateLimitError`: Represents a rate limit error.
- `openai.error.ServiceUnavailableError`: Represents an unavailable service error.
- `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`: Represents an error that occurs when decoding JSON.
- `AssertionError`: Represents an assertion error.

These error types can be caught and handled using appropriate exception-handling techniques.

## handle_openai_error

The `handle_openai_error` function is a utility function used to handle OpenAI errors or related errors that may be raised during API calls. It takes the error object and an API call counter as input.

```python
api_call_counter = handle_openai_error(error, api_call_counter)
```

The function logs the error, handles certain types of errors by waiting or retrying the API call, and re-raises all other errors immediately.

This function can be used to handle errors in a consistent and controlled manner when working with the OpenAI API.
