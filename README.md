# prompt2model

## What is this?

This is a package that takes a prompt, like one that you might send to an OpenAI model such as GPT-3 or GPT-4, and uses it to create a model that you can use to solve the task in the prompt.

## Installation

You can install by running pip locally.

```bash
pip install .
```

If you're a developer, you should also install pre-commit hooks before developing.
