{"pretrained_model_name": "RamAnanth1/positive-reframing", "description": "# Positive Perspectives with Text Reframing\n\nBased on the paper [Inducing Positive Perspectives with Text Reframing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952), this model focuses on the positive reframing task. The purpose of the model is to neutralize a negative point of view and generate a more positive perspective without changing the original meaning.\n\nThe model provided is obtained from this [HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ella2323/Positive-Reframing) and stored in a separate repository to increase ease of use. All credits go to the original contributors of the abovementioned HuggingFace Space.\n\n### Available strategies for positive reframing:\n\n**growth**: viewing a challenging event as an opportunity for the author to specifically grow or improve himself.\n\n**impermanence**: Saying that bad things don't last forever, will get better soon, and/or that other people have had similar difficulties.\n\n**neutralizing**: Replacing a negative word with a neutral word. For example, \u201cThis was a terrible day\u201d becomes \u201cThis was a long day\u201d.\n\n**optimism**: Focusing on things about the situation itself, at that moment, that are good (not just predicting a better future).\n\n**self_affirmation**: Talking about what strengths the author already has, or values he admires, such as love, courage, perseverance, etc.\n\n**thankfulness**: Expressing gratitude or gratitude with keywords like appreciate, happy for it, grateful for, good thing, etc.\n", "size_bytes": "1625537793", "downloads": 6}
