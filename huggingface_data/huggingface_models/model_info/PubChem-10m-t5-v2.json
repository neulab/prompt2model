Compared to PubChem-10m-t5, PubChem-10m-t5-v2 uses a character-level tokenizer, and it was also trained on PubChem.\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis model can be used for the prediction of molecules' properties, reactions, or interactions with proteins by changing the way of finetuning.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nWe downloaded [PubChem data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygYs8dy1-vxD1Vx6Ux7ftrXwZctFjpV3/view) and canonicalized them using RDKit. Then, we dropped duplicates. The total number of data is 9999960, and they were randomly split into train:validation=10:1.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-03\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10.0\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Step   | Accuracy | Validation Loss |\n|:-------------:|:------:|:--------:|:---------------:|\n| 0.2592        | 100000 | 0.8997   | 0.2784          |\n| 0.2790        | 200000 | 0.9095   | 0.2468          |\n| 0.2278        | 300000 | 0.9162   | 0.2256          |", "size_bytes": "794028109", "downloads": 5}
