The original Github repository is [https://github.com/jzbjyb/OmniTab](https://github.com/jzbjyb/OmniTab).\n\n## Description\n\n`neulab/omnitab-large-128shot-finetuned-wtq-128shot` (based on BART architecture) is initialized with `neulab/omnitab-large-128shot` and fine-tuned on [WikiTableQuestions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitablequestions) in the 128-shot setting.\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"neulab/omnitab-large-128shot-finetuned-wtq-128shot\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"neulab/omnitab-large-128shot-finetuned-wtq-128shot\")\n\ndata = {\n    \"year\": [1896, 1900, 1904, 2004, 2008, 2012],\n    \"city\": [\"athens\", \"paris\", \"st. louis\", \"athens\", \"beijing\", \"london\"]\n}\ntable = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)\n\nquery = \"In which year did beijing host the Olympic Games?\"\nencoding = tokenizer(table=table, query=query, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**encoding)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))\n# [' 2008']\n```\n\n## Reference\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{jiang-etal-2022-omnitab,\n  title = \"{O}mni{T}ab: Pretraining with Natural and Synthetic Data for Few-shot Table-based Question Answering\",\n  author = \"Jiang, Zhengbao and Mao, Yi and He, Pengcheng and Neubig, Graham and Chen, Weizhu\",\n  booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 2022 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies\",\n  month = jul,\n  year = \"2022\",\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "812847041", "downloads": 48}
