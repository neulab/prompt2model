For training, we utilized text retrieval for each query, which provides a collection of relevant passages for it.\n\nWe note that the passages were retrieved using a corpus based on [Wikipedia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wiki_dpr).\n\n# Evaluation\n\nSee model performance on Evaluation Results tab on the right side.", "size_bytes": "495196159", "downloads": 114}
