Please note that, during training:\ni) it was not specified to which features the characters were associated with; ii) in accordance with the HVDC system, the presence of the dreamer is not assessed.\n\nIt achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 0.4674\n- Rouge1: 0.7853\n- Rouge2: 0.6927\n- Rougel: 0.7564\n- Rougelsum: 0.7565\n\n## Model description\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 0.0002\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 16\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10\n- mixed_precision_training: Native AMP\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Rouge1 | Rouge2 | Rougel | Rougelsum |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:---------:|\n| No log        | 1.0   | 93   | 0.6486          | 0.5936 | 0.4495 | 0.5705 | 0.5701    |\n| No log        | 2.0   | 186  | 0.5363          | 0.7196 | 0.6020 | 0.6990 | 0.6983    |\n| No log        | 3.0   | 279  | 0.4391          | 0.7568 | 0.6459 | 0.7235 | 0.7244    |\n| No log        | 4.0   | 372  | 0.4223          | 0.7751 | 0.6748 | 0.7473 | 0.7477    |\n| No log        | 5.0   | 465  | 0.4266          | 0.7789 | 0.6746 | 0.7512 | 0.7522    |\n| 0.6336        | 6.0   | 558  | 0.4296          | 0.7810 | 0.6790 | 0.7537 | 0.7539    |\n| 0.6336        | 7.0   | 651  | 0.4400          | 0.7798 | 0.6808 | 0.7537 | 0.7543    |\n| 0.6336        | 8.0   | 744  | 0.4497          | 0.7749 | 0.6821 | 0.7471 | 0.7481    |\n| 0.6336        | 9.0   | 837  | 0.4661          | 0.7828 | 0.6910 | 0.7554 | 0.7563    |\n| 0.6336        | 10.0  | 930  | 0.4674          | 0.7853 | 0.6927 | 0.7564 | 0.7565    |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.25.1\n- Pytorch 1.12.1\n- Datasets 2.5.1\n- Tokenizers 0.12.1\n\n### Cite \nIf you use the model, please cite the pre-print.\n```bibtex\n@misc{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.14828,\n  doi = {10.48550/ARXIV.2302.14828},\n  url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14828},\n  author = {Bertolini, Lorenzo and Elce, Valentina and Michalak, Adriana and Bernardi, Giulio and Weeds, Julie},\n  keywords = {Computation and Language (cs.CL), FOS: Computer and information sciences, FOS: Computer and information sciences},\n  title = {Automatic Scoring of Dream Reports' Emotional Content with Large Language Models},\n  publisher = {arXiv},\n  year = {2023},\n  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "891700799", "downloads": 11}
