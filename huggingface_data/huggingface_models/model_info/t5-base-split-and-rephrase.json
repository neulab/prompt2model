(Narayan et al., 2017) \n\nE.g.:\n```\nCystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs,\nwhich is common in the Caucasian population, symptomatically affecting 1 in 2500 newborns in the UK,\nand more than 80,000 individuals globally.\n```\ncould be split into\n```\nCystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs. \n```\n```\nCystic Fibrosis is common in the Caucasian population.\n```\n```\nCystic Fibrosis affects 1 in 2500 newborns in the UK. \n```\n```\nCystic Fibrosis affects more than 80,000 individuals globally.\n```\n\n## How to use it in your code:\n```python\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\ncheckpoint=\"unikei/t5-base-split-and-rephrase\"\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\n\ncomplex_sentence = \"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that \\\naffects multiple organs, which is common in the Caucasian \\\npopulation, symptomatically affecting 1 in 2500 newborns in \\\nthe UK, and more than 80,000 individuals globally.\"\ncomplex_tokenized = tokenizer(complex_sentence, \n                                 padding=\"max_length\", \n                                 truncation=True,\n                                 max_length=256, \n                                 return_tensors='pt')\n\nsimple_tokenized = model.generate(complex_tokenized['input_ids'], attention_mask = complex_tokenized['attention_mask'], max_length=256, num_beams=5)\nsimple_sentences = tokenizer.batch_decode(simple_tokenized, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(simple_sentences)\n\n\"\"\"\nOutput:\nCystic Fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs. Cystic Fibrosis affects 1 in 2500 newborns in the UK. Cystic Fibrosis affects more than 80,000 individuals globally. Cystic Fibrosis is common in the Caucasian population.\n\"\"\"\n```", "size_bytes": "891702929", "downloads": 308}
