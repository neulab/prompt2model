However, the model is mostly meant to be fine-tuned on a supervised dataset. BART is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (e.g. summarization, translation) but also works well for comprehension tasks (e.g. text classification, question answering).\n\n## How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BartTokenizer, BartModel\ntokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('projecte-aina/bart-base-ca')\nmodel = BartModel.from_pretrained('projecte-aina/bart-base-ca')\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hola, el meu gos \u00e9s molt bonic\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n```\n\n## Limitations and bias\nAt the time of submission, no measures have been taken to estimate the bias embedded in the model. However, we are well aware that our models may be biased since the corpora have been collected using crawling techniques on multiple web sources. We intend to conduct research in these areas in the future, and if completed, this model card will be updated.\n\n## Training\n\n### Training data\n\nAs training data, we used the [Catalan Textual Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/catalan_textual_corpus), a 1760-million-token web corpus of Catalan built from several sources.\n\n### Training procedure\n\n#### Tokenization\n\nThe training corpus has been tokenized using a byte version of [Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) with a vocabulary size of 51,200 tokens. \n\n#### Hyperparameters\n\nThe hyperparameters were adapted for [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/bart/README.md) from the original BART's paper.\n\n| Hyper-parameter                    | Value  |\n|------------------------------------|--------|\n| Learning Rate                      | 5e-4 |\n| Learning Rate Decay                | Polynomial Decay |\n| Warmup Updates                            | 10000   |\n| Batch Size                         | 2048     |\n| Weight Decay                       | 0.01   |\n| Max.
