What is Parrot?\nParrot is a paraphrase based utterance augmentation framework purpose built to accelerate training NLU models. A paraphrase framework is more than just a paraphrasing model. For more  details on the library and usage please refer to the [github page](https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot)\n\n\n### Installation\n```python\npip install git+https://github.com/PrithivirajDamodaran/Parrot_Paraphraser.git\n```\n\n### Quickstart\n\n```python\n\n\nfrom parrot import Parrot\nimport torch\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n\n''' \nuncomment to get reproducable paraphrase generations\ndef random_state(seed):\n  torch.manual_seed(seed)\n  if torch.cuda.is_available():\n    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)\n\nrandom_state(1234)\n'''\n\n#Init models (make sure you init ONLY once if you integrate this to your code)\nparrot = Parrot(model_tag=\"prithivida/parrot_paraphraser_on_T5\", use_gpu=False)\n\nphrases = [\"Can you recommed some upscale restaurants in Newyork?\",\n           \"What are the famous places we should not miss in Russia?\"\n]\n\nfor phrase in phrases:\n  print(\"-\"*100)\n  print(\"Input_phrase: \", phrase)\n  print(\"-\"*100)\n  para_phrases = parrot.augment(input_phrase=phrase)\n  for para_phrase in para_phrases:\n   print(para_phrase)\n```\n\n```\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput_phrase: Can you recommed some upscale restaurants in Newyork?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nlist some excellent restaurants to visit in new york city?\nwhat upscale restaurants do you recommend in new york?\ni want to try some upscale restaurants in new york?\nrecommend some upscale restaurants in newyork?\ncan you recommend some high end restaurants in newyork?\ncan you recommend some upscale restaurants in new york?\ncan you recommend some upscale restaurants in newyork?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nInput_phrase: What are the famous places we should not miss in Russia\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nwhat should we not miss when visiting russia?\nrecommend some of the best places to visit in russia?\nlist some of the best places to visit in russia?\ncan you list the top places to visit in russia?\nshow the places that we should not miss in russia?\nlist some famous places which we should not miss in russia?\n```\n\n\n### Knobs\n\n```python\n\n para_phrases = parrot.augment(input_phrase=phrase, \n                               diversity_ranker=\"levenshtein\",\n                               do_diverse=False, \n                               max_return_phrases = 10, \n                               max_length=32, \n                               adequacy_threshold = 0.99, \n                               fluency_threshold = 0.90)\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Why Parrot?\n**Huggingface** lists [12 paraphrase models,](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text2text-generation&search=paraphrase)  **RapidAPI** lists 7 fremium and commercial paraphrasers like [QuillBot](https://rapidapi.com/search/paraphrase?section=apis&page=1), Rasa has discussed an experimental paraphraser for augmenting text data [here](https://forum.rasa.com/t/paraphrasing-for-nlu-data-augmentation-experimental/27744), Sentence-transfomers offers a [paraphrase mining utility](https://www.sbert.net/examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html) and [NLPAug](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug) offers word level augmentation with a [PPDB](http://paraphrase.org/#/download) (a multi-million paraphrase database). While these attempts at paraphrasing are great, there are still some gaps and paraphrasing is NOT yet a mainstream option for text augmentation in building NLU models....Parrot is a humble attempt to fill some of these gaps.\n\n**What is a good paraphrase?** Almost all conditioned text generation models are validated  on 2 factors, (1) if the generated text conveys the same meaning as the original context (Adequacy) (2) if the text is fluent / grammatically correct english (Fluency). For instance Neural Machine Translation outputs are tested for Adequacy and Fluency. But [a good paraphrase](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1090.pdf) should be adequate and fluent while being as different as possible on the surface lexical form. With respect to this definition, the  **3 key metrics** that measures the quality of paraphrases are:\n - **Adequacy** (Is the meaning preserved adequately?) \n - **Fluency** (Is the paraphrase fluent English?) \n - **Diversity (Lexical / Phrasal / Syntactical)** (How much has the paraphrase changed the original sentence?)\n\n*Parrot offers knobs to control Adequacy, Fluency and Diversity as per your needs.*\n\n**What makes a paraphraser a good augmentor?** For training a NLU model we just don't need a lot of utterances but utterances with intents and slots/entities annotated. Typical flow would be:\n- Given an **input utterance  + input annotations** a good augmentor spits out N **output paraphrases** while preserving the intent and slots. \n - The output paraphrases are then converted into annotated data using the input annotations that we got in step 1.\n - The annotated data created out of the output paraphrases then makes the training dataset for your NLU model.\n\nBut in general being a generative model paraphrasers doesn't guarantee to preserve the slots/entities. So the ability to generate high quality paraphrases in a constrained fashion without trading off the intents and slots for lexical dissimilarity makes a paraphraser a good augmentor. *More on this in section 3 below*\n\n## 3. Scope\n\nIn the space of conversational engines, knowledge bots are to which **we ask questions** like *\"when was the Berlin wall teared down?\"*, transactional bots are to which **we give commands** like *\"Turn on the music please\"* and voice assistants are the ones which can do both answer questions and action our commands. Parrot mainly foucses on augmenting texts typed-into or spoken-to conversational interfaces for building robust NLU models. (*So usually people neither type out or yell out long paragraphs to conversational interfaces. Hence the pre-trained model is trained  on text samples of maximum length of 32.*)\n\n*While Parrot predominantly aims to be a text augmentor for building good NLU models, it can also be used as a pure-play paraphraser.*\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "891737400", "downloads": 152230}
