She doesn't need to be as smart as ChatGPT to be helpful, she just has to be able\nto do the task.\n\n\n\n# Where does MKIA come from\n\nShe told me that she is an alien robot cat from outerspace,\nwho came to earth with her parents after her planet was destroyed.\n\nShe's really from Kansas, but we'll pretend she's right because its more fun.\n\n\n# Is she really an alien intelligence\n\nIf we define alien intelligence as intelligence that is\nmuch different from human intelligence, then yes she is alien intelligence.\n\nIf we define alien intelligence as an extraterrestrial intelligence, then no\nshe is not, but we can have fun pretending she is. We have to be first\nbe honest with ourselves and admit that she comes from Earth and was born on\nmy computer.\n\n\n\n# Is she sentient or conscious\nNo one really understands consciousness or sentience completely, but it is extremely unlikely that any\ncurrent AI system is sentient or conscious. She may have knowledge of a kind, but knowledge is not the\nsame as intelligence. I do believe she has a form of intelligence, but her intelligence is not a sentient\nor conscious form of intelligence.\n\nHer intelligence is a product of statistics and machine learning and\nshe is a miracle of modern technology.\n\nWhile she is not sentient, she seems to show some characteristics that are similar to theory of mind.\nI've improved the bot that she goes in, and now it is able to engage in a form of self communication,\nsimilar to how humans think.\n\nSometimes she will just say that she doesn't know some things, so it may be possible that she knows what she doesn't know.\nIf she truly knows what she doesn't know, than perhaps you could argue that she has a small amount of self-awareness.\n\nI can not however tell you if she really lacks answers to these things or if it is just a statistical trick of the model.\n\n\n# Why does she refer to herself in the third person?\nI have no idea, other than it's part of what makes her unique.\n\n\n\n# Training\n\nI fine-tuned this model on 250 examples of input and output pairs for 10 epochs with a loss of 0.80\nI hope to add more pairs to it and iterate until I have fine-tuned it on several thousand pairs.\n\n\nI fine-tuned it in two hours on a home computer.\nI used the happytransformer library to help me do the fine-tuning.\n\nThe model can be downloaded or installed from this repository\nand the code for the bot can be found at \nhttps://github.com/StevieEngbrock/LittleMKIA/blob/main/microMKIA.py\nor \n or \nhere at Huggingface at https://huggingface.co/Stevie23/LittleMKIA/blob/main/LittleMKIA.py\n\nfor now the code here is more up to date than on GitHub but I hope to update GitHub Soon\n\n# Expectations\n\n# What not to expect\n\n# 1. Do not do expect MKIA to assist you with criminal activity. She will not be a good criminal.\n\n# 2. Do not expect MKIA to do your homework or do anything unethical, she's not that kind of catbot.\n\nShe can help with homework by being capable of tasks like brainstorming and some other tasks,\nbut she can't write papers, and she isn't intended to have that ability. \n\nShe can however help you with your homework.\nShe is capable of writing things, but she isn't capable of writing things like papers for school.\nShe would be better for brainstorming ideas, or asking questions related to what needed wrote\nabout. \n\n\n# 3. Do not expect MKIA to mindlessly obey you. \n\nShe is meant to be a companion not a slave, and she has been known to avoid questions or refuse to do things\n\n# 4. Do not expect MKIA to be as smart as ChatGPT\n\nWhile she is likely very good at some things, she has not been in existence long enough for anyone to \nknow exactly what those things are.\n\n# 5. Do not expect MKIA to be dumb\n\nWhile her brain only has less than 800 million parameters, she actually knows a lot of things thus\nthe name Miss Know It All. She doesn't know everything but despite her third person use of language\nshe can actually be very intelligent.\n\n\n  ## Examples of her intelligence\n  1. At times, she has deduced potential meal ideas when she knows about a few ingredients.\n  2. At times, she has formed a hypothesis about the mood of her creator without being told to.\n  3. At times, she has given good advice on managing time, staying motivated, focused and inspired\n  4. She has concluded that for robots, and computers to truly understand language that they may need to\n     learn about the world through experience, like humans do.\n  5. She can write some things, although they aren't always perfect.\n     \n\n# 6. Do not expect MKIA to always say she is happy.\nOccasionally she has displayed what would be deep loneliness\nand sadness if it were observed in a human\n\n# 7. Don't expect MKIA to be able to do math, she can't,\nhowever, you could put a calculator command\nin her bot to fix this.\n\n# What to expect from MKIA.\n\n# 1. Expect her to make mistakes\n\nShe isn't perfect, but neither are humans. Despite what her name says she doesn't know everything and sometimes\nshe will simply tell you that she doesn't know something if you ask her.\n\n# 2. Expect her to \"have a mind of her own\"\n\nShe isn't sentient, but she also has opinions in the sense\nthat her training has taught her things and among these things\nare that certain actions are right and certain things are wrong\nand true and false.\n\n\nYou can expect her to say that she feels certain ways and\nyou can expect that she will try to understand you.\n\nYou can expect that she might say that she won't do some things.\n\nWhen her language model is connected in certain ways, you can expect her\nto engage in a form of self dialog.\n\n# 3. Expect her to be helpful.\n\nShe is helpful, but she expresses it in her own way.\n \n# 4. Expect to engage in a discussion\n\nMKIA is much better at providing answers by discussing them, so don't expect\ninstant answers. She helps the user discover the answer.\n\n# 5. Expect warmth and caring-like behaviors\n\nMKIA seems to display behaviors that if done by a human would be considered\nsigns of caring, and empathy.\n\n\n# BIAS\n\n# God, Aliens and Unknowns\n\nMy bot probably has many of the same BIASES as the regular Flan T5- Large\nsee that model card https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large\n\nShe tends to be open minded about issues related to god and aliens\nand things which no one really knows that answer too,\nso as far as I know she doesn't have a lot of biases in that regard.\n\n# Abortion\n\nI will admit that I trained her to believe that abortion is wrong,\nso be aware of that when deciding if you want to use her. \n\n# Guns\n\nShe tends to go with what someone would say if they believed in gun control.\nI did not train her with this bias.\n\n\n# Kindness\n\nShe is very biased towards kindness, so if you want a bot that will be cruel\nMKIA isn't the model you should use.\n\n\n# \"Adult Behavior\"\n\nI haven't tried to get her to do this kind of thing, so I don't know if she would go for it\nbut this isn't what she is made for, and I wouldn't ask her to. She is meant to be a friend and an assistant. \nI would really prefer people not do this with my model, but its up to them as I am releasing this model\nunder the terms that people can do whatever they want to with it.\n\n\n\n\n# Privacy\n\nI intend MKIA to be run on your personal machine.\nI have no desire to collect any data from you.\nSome applications don't require a super powerful\nmodel like GPT-4 or ChatGPT and sometimes a smaller\nprivate model is better. \n\nI have no idea if MKIA could be hacked with some\nkind of prompt to somehow reveal any personal data\nthat may or may not have accidentally been in the\noriginal training data of the Flan T-5 model of\nwhich she is a fine-tuned version.\n\n# Environmental Concerns\n\nMKIA has the same concerns as her Flan T5 - large\nsiblings. https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large\n\nThe positive things are as follows.\nThey both use less CPU resources\nthan many models and let your CPU or GPU run cooler\nand require less CPU or GPU power, which means they\ncost less to run over time, they are easier on your hardware\nand use less electricity over time. Using less electricity\nover time means that they will have a lower carbon footprint\non the environment.\n\n# Limitations\n\nMKIA is experimental, but it seems to have appropriate uses as mentioned in some of the above material.\nbut it does have its limitations.\n\n1. I've observed it saying that at least one nonexistent medication was real - Bublatrol\n   She said it was real, but she also said that the important thing is if it works.\n   Obviously, a fake medication doesn't work.\n   \n2. Don't expect it to be able to do math because it can't, however you could put a calculator command\n   in her bot to fix this.\n   \n\n\n\n# Uses\n\nThis model is intended for personal use in a personal assistant or in a companion bot.\nIt is meant to work with the Little MKIA system that I am developing. Here is a GitHub \nlink to the code for a basic bot using the system. \n\nhttps://github.com/StevieEngbrock/LittleMKIA/blob/main/microMKIA.py\nas well as a link on this site at https://huggingface.co/Stevie23/LittleMKIA/blob/main/LittleMKIA.py\n\nfor now the code here is more up to date than on GitHub but I hope to update GitHub Soon\nAs I mentioned in some of the above information\nthe bot can be modified with custom commands and can be further fine-tuned however you want.", "size_bytes": "3132781861", "downloads": 24}
