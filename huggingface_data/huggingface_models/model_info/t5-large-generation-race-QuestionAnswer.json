If you would like to have **extractive** questions/answers, you can use our model trained on SQuAD: https://huggingface.co/potsawee/t5-large-generation-squad-QuestionAnswer.\n\n## Model Details\n\nt5-large model is fine-tuned to the RACE dataset where the input is the context/passage and the output is the question followed by the answer. This is the first component in the question generation pipeline (i.e. `g1`) in our [MQAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12307), \nor please refer to the GitHub repo of this project: https://github.com/potsawee/mqag0.\n\n## How to Use the Model\n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. You can also set do_sample=True in generate() to obtain different question-answer pairs.\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"potsawee/t5-large-generation-race-QuestionAnswer\")\n>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"potsawee/t5-large-generation-race-QuestionAnswer\")\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n... World number one Novak Djokovic says he is hoping for a \"positive decision\" to allow him \n... to play at Indian Wells and the Miami Open next month. The United States has extended \n... its requirement for international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
