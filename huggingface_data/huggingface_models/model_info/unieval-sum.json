It can evaluate the model output from four dimensions:\n- *coherence*\n- *consistency*\n- *fluency*\n- *relevance*\n\nIt can also be transferred to the new dimensions and generation tasks, such as *naturalness* and *informativeness* for data-to-text.\n\n## Usage \n\nPlease refer to [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/maszhongming/UniEval).", "size_bytes": "3132623525", "downloads": 6644}
