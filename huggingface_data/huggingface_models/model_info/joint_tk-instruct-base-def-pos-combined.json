The finetuning was carried out by adding prompts of the form: \n - definition + 2 positive examples + 2 negative examples + 2 neutral examples\n\nThe prompt is prepended onto each input review. It is important to note that **this model output was finetuned on samples from the laptops and restaurants domains.**\nThe code for the official implementation of the paper [**InstructABSA: Instruction Learning for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08624) can be \nfound [here](https://github.com/kevinscaria/InstructABSA).\n\nFor the Joint Task, this model is the current SOTA.\n\n## Training data\n\nInstructABSA models are trained on the benchmark dataset for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis tasks viz. SemEval 2014. This [dataset](https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/index.php?id=data-and-tools) consists of reviews \nfrom laptops and restaurant domains and their corresponding aspect term and polarity labels.\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\nIf you use this model in your work, please cite the following paper:\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{Scaria2023InstructABSAIL,\n  title={InstructABSA: Instruction Learning for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis},\n  author={Kevin Scaria and Himanshu Gupta and Saurabh Arjun Sawant and Swaroop Mishra and Chitta Baral},\n  year={2023}\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "990236853", "downloads": 9}
