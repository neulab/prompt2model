Set aside for 1/2 an hour to infuse. Added flavour can be released by pressing down\non the rosemary leaves with a spoon. Add the pieces to the blender or food processor with the\nelderflower cordial. Blend or process to a pur\u00e9e.,, Add the lemon or lime juice and stir to\ncombine., Add a cover and place in the freezer.After 2 hours, remove from the freezer and break up\nwith a fork. This helps the ice crystals to form properly.Continue doing this every hour until the\ngranita freezes properly. Scoop the granita into dessert bowls and serve. Garnish with a cucumber\ncurl or a small sprig of rosemary.\"\nmetrics:\n- Rouge1: 31.2\n- RougeL: 24.5\n---\n\n# Model name\nWikihow T5-small\n\n## Model description\n\nThis is a T5-small model trained on Wikihow All data set.
