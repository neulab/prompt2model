Comparing Character- and Subword-level Models for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14220).\nIt is a ByT5 model finetuned on German-->English translation using 250k sentence pairs from the WMT NewsCommentary v16 dataset. \n\nTo use the model correctly, you must prepend the prompt with \"translate X to Y: \", where X and Y are your source and target languages (e.g. German, English).\n\n\nNOTE: The decoder_start_token_id is 259 for byt5 models and 250099 for mt5 models, which is different from the default token from google's byt5 and mt5 models (which is 0).", "size_bytes": "1198609653", "downloads": 4}
