It is not enough for good prediction, nevertheless, there is some result.\n\nNowdays, we are collecting more sentences to improve our result. And, I hope, it gives us opportunity to not use pre-trained models and realize translator on R instead of python.\n\nDataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/TSjB/qm_ru_parallel\n\nWhere to use:\n\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/TSjB/QM_RU_translator\n\nhttps://tsjb-qm-ru-translator.hf.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/QMKochBot", "size_bytes": "2453869853", "downloads": 8}
