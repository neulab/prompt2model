'To' and 'towards' are <prepositions> that indicate direction.\n\nI want to stop smoking during driving bicycle .\t23:29\tA <gerund> does not normally follow the <preposition> <<during>>. Think of an expression using the <conjunction> 'while' instead of a <preposition>.\n\n```\n\nGrammar termins are highlighted with '< ... >' marks and word examples - with '<< ... >>'\n\n####  Data preprocessing\n\nWe lowercased the text, split it from any punctuation, including task specific marks (<< >>) and explicitly pointed out the error in the original text using << >>.\n\n```\nthe smoke < < flow > > < < my > > face .\t10:17 When the < verb > < < flow > > is used as an < intransitive verb > to express '' to move in a stream '', a < preposition > needs to be placed to indicate the direction. ' to ' and ' towards ' are < prepositions > that indicate direction .\n\ni want to stop smoking < < during > > driving bicycle .\t23:29\ta < gerund > does not normally follow the < preposition > < < during > > . think of an expression using the < conjunction > ' while ' instead of a < preposition > .\n```\n\n####  Data augmentation\n\nThe main feature of our training pipeline was data augmentation. The idea of the augmentation is as follows: we cut the existing text with error after the last word which was syntactically connected to the words inside the error span (syntactic dependencies were automatically parsed with spacy) and this cut version of the text with error was used as a prompt for language model (we used [GPT-Neo 1.3B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B)).\n\nUsing both initial and augmented data we fine-tuned [t5-large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n\n\n## Licensing Information\n\n[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License][cc-by-nc-sa].\n\n[![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-image]][cc-by-nc-sa]\n\n[cc-by-nc-sa]: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n[cc-by-nc-sa-image]: https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png", "size_bytes": "2950837703", "downloads": 5}
