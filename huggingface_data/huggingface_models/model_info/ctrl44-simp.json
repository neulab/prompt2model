It was trained on the IRSD simplification dataset.\n\nA control token is expected at the start of input sequences to dictate which simplification operation should be performed. This can either be done manually or with an operation classifier like [this one](https://huggingface.co/liamcripwell/ctrl44-clf).\n\nPossible control tokens are: \"\\<ident\\>\", \"\\<para\\>\", \"\\<ssplit\\>\", and \"\\<dsplit\\>\".\n\n## How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import BartForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"liamcripwell/ctrl44-simp\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"liamcripwell/ctrl44-simp\")\n\ntext = \"<para> Barack Hussein Obama II is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017.\"\ninputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model.generate(**inputs, num_beams=10, max_length=128)\n```", "size_bytes": "557988537", "downloads": 10}
