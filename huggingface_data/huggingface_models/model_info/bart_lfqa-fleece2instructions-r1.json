Consider the type of atmosphere and the size of\n    the area that will be suitable for the number of guests you plan to invite.\n    Choose the right decorations based on your brother's interests, such as\n    balloons in his favorite colors, banners, and streamers. Next, decide on the\n    food and drinks, making sure they are tasty and appropriate for the\n    occasion. Then decide on the other games, music, and entertainment that will\n    make the party memorable. Finally, involve your brother's friends and family\n    to help create the perfect surprise.\n  example_title: birthday party\n- text: 1) cookies and cream 2) chocolate chip 3) mint chip 4) oreo\n  example_title: ice cream\n- text: >-\n    Start by\n    selecting a scale model of a building that fits the theme. Use a hobby knife\n    and glue to cut and assemble the model into a ruined or abandoned version of\n    itself, adding details like broken windows and graffiti. Create a base for\n    the diorama using foam, plaster, or other materials, and paint it to\n    resemble a ruined street or sidewalk. Add miniature vehicles, debris, and\n    figures to complete the scene, and use weathering techniques like dry\n    brushing and rust washes to add realism. Display the diorama in a shadow box\n    or other protective case to showcase your work.\n  example_title: Miniature diorama creation\n- text: >-\n    Start by selecting\n    clothing that is futuristic and edgy, such as leather jackets, neon-colored\n    accessories, and tech-inspired patterns. Add accessories like goggles,\n    cybernetic implants, and LED lights to enhance the cyberpunk vibe. Use\n    makeup and body paint to create a futuristic look, such as metallic skin or\n    neon makeup. Consider adding functional elements to your costume, such as a\n    built-in backpack or hidden pockets for your tech gadgets. Finally, practice\n    your confident walk and embrace your inner cyberpunk for a memorable and\n    immersive costume experience.\n  example_title: Cyberpunk costume design\n- text: >-\n    Start by creating a base\n    terrain with mountains, valleys, and other natural features. Use fractal\n    noise and displacement mapping to add texture and detail to the terrain, and\n    experiment with different materials like rock, grass, and water. Add surreal\n    elements like floating islands, giant mushrooms, or impossible geometry to\n    create a dreamlike atmosphere. Use lighting and color grading to enhance the\n    mood and tone of the scene, and render the final image at a high resolution\n    for maximum impact. Share your surreal landscape with the world and inspire\n    others to explore the possibilities of 3D art.\n  example_title: Surreal 3D landscape creation\n- text: >-\n    Start by setting a realistic goal and creating a\n    training plan. Build up your mileage gradually over time, and incorporate\n    cross-training and strength exercises to prevent injury and improve\n    endurance. Be sure to stay hydrated and properly fuel your body with\n    nutritious foods. Listen to your body and adjust your training as needed to\n    avoid overexertion or burnout. Finally, taper your training in the weeks\n    leading up to the race to give your body time to rest and recover before the\n    big day.\n  example_title: Marathon training\n---\n\n<!-- This model card has been generated automatically according to the information the Trainer had access to.
