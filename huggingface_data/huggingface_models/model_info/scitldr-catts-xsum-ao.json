TLDR generation involves high source compression and requires expert background knowledge and understanding of complex domain-specific language. To facilitate study on this task, we introduce SciTLDR, a new multi-target dataset of 5.4K TLDRs over 3.2K papers. SciTLDR contains both author-written and expert-derived TLDRs, where the latter are collected using a novel annotation protocol that produces high-quality summaries while minimizing annotation burden. We propose CATTS, a simple yet effective learning strategy for generating TLDRs that exploits titles as an auxiliary training signal. CATTS improves upon strong baselines under both automated metrics and human evaluations.\"\nlicense: \"apache-2.0\"\n\n---\n\n# AI2 SciTLDR\nFairseq checkpoints from CATTS XSUM to Transformers BART (Abtract Only)\n\nOriginal repository: [https://github.com/allenai/scitldr](https://github.com/allenai/scitldr)\n\n## Demo\nA running demo of AI2 model can be found [here](https://scitldr.apps.allenai.org).\n\n### Citing\nIf you use code, dataset, or model weights in your research, please cite \"TLDR: Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents.\"\n\n```\n@article{cachola2020tldr,\n  title={{TLDR}: Extreme Summarization of Scientific Documents},\n  author={Isabel Cachola and Kyle Lo and Arman Cohan and Daniel S.
