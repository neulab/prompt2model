It acheives the following results on the validation set\n- Accuracy: 0.9123\n\n\n## Model Details\nT5 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which each task is converted into a text-to-text format. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Tokenization\nSince, T5 is a text-to-text model, the labels of the dataset are converted as follows:\nFor each example, a sentence as been formed as **\"qnli question: \" + qnli_question + \"sentence: \" + qnli_sentence** and fed to the tokenizer to get the **input_ids** and **attention_mask**.\nFor each label, label is choosen as **\"equivalent\"** if label is 1, else label is **\"not_equivalent\"** and tokenized to get **input_ids** and **attention_mask** . \n  During training, these inputs_ids having **pad** token are replaced with -100 so that loss is not calculated for them. Then these input ids are given as labels, and above attention_mask of labels\n  is given as decoder attention mask.\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 3e-4\n- train_batch_size: 8\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: epsilon=1e-08\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n\n### Training results\n\n\n|Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Accuracy |\n|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|\n|   1  |    0.0571     |  0.8973             |\n|   2  |    0.0329     |  0.9068              |\n|   3  |    0.0133     |  0.9123              |\n", "size_bytes": "891699345", "downloads": 96}
