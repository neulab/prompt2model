It inherits the same risks and limitations as mentioned in Meta's model card.\n\n> Like other large language models for which the diversity (or lack thereof) of training\n> data induces downstream impact on the quality of our model, OPT-175B has limitations in terms\n> of bias and safety. OPT-175B can also have quality issues in terms of generation diversity and\n> hallucination. In general, OPT-175B is not immune from the plethora of issues that plague modern\n> large language models.\n> \n\nVideoBLIP has not been tested in real world applications. It should not be directly deployed in any applications. Researchers should first carefully assess the safety and fairness of the model in relation to the specific context they\u2019re being deployed within.\n\n\n### How to use\n\nFor code examples, please refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/yukw777/VideoBLIP).", "size_bytes": 15493505024, "downloads": 82}
