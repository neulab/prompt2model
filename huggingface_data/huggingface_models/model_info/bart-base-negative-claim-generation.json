This model is used in the data augmentation process described in the paper [CrossAug: A Contrastive Data Augmentation Method for Debiasing Fact Verification Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.15107). The model has been fine-tuned using the parallel and opposing claims from WikiFactCheck-English dataset.\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\nmodel_name = 'minwhoo/bart-base-negative-claim-generation'\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel.to('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')\n\nexamples = [\n    \"Little Miss Sunshine was filmed over 30 days.\",\n    \"Magic Johnson did not play for the Lakers.\",\n    \"Claire Danes is wedded to an actor from England.\"\n]\n\nbatch = tokenizer(examples, max_length=1024, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nout = model.generate(batch['input_ids'].to(model.device), num_beams=5)\nnegative_examples = tokenizer.batch_decode(out, skip_special_tokens=True)\nprint(negative_examples)\n# ['Little Miss Sunshine was filmed less than 3 days.', 'Magic Johnson played for the Lakers.', 'Claire Danes is married to an actor from France.']\n```\n\n## Citation\n\n```\n@inproceedings{lee2021crossaug,\n  title={CrossAug: A Contrastive Data Augmentation Method for Debiasing Fact Verification Models},\n  author={Minwoo Lee and Seungpil Won and Juae Kim and Hwanhee Lee and Cheoneum Park and Kyomin Jung},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Information & Knowledge Management},\n  publisher={Association for Computing Machinery},\n  series={CIKM '21},\n  year={2021}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "557982035", "downloads": 50}
