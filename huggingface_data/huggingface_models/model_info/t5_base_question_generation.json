The max sequence length is 512 tokens. Inputs should be organised into the following format: \\<generate_questions\\>  paragraph:  context text here'\n\nThe input sequence can then be encoded and passed as the input_ids argument in the model's generate() method.\n\n\n\n##  limitations\n\nThe model was trained on only a limited amount of data hence questions might be poor quality. In addition the questions generated have style similar to that of the training data. \n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThe model takes as input a passage to generate questions answerable by the passage. \nThe dataset used to train the model comprises 80k passage-question pairs sampled randomly from the SQUAD training data. For the evaluation we sampled 10k passage-question pairs from the SQUAD development set. \n\n## Training procedure\nThe model was trained for 5 epochs over the training set with a learning rate of 5e-05 with EarlyStopping. The batch size was only 10 due to GPU memory limitations \n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: cosine\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_ratio: 0.21\n- num_epochs: 5\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.23.1\n- Pytorch 1.13.0\n- Datasets 2.6.1\n- Tokenizers 0.13.1\n", "size_bytes": "891629201", "downloads": 22}
