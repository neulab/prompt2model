However previous work has not systematically evaluated the efficacy of different\npretraining language distributions across model scales. In this paper, we propose a new sampling method, UniMax,\nthat delivers more uniform coverage of head languages while mitigating overfitting on tail languages by explicitly\ncapping the number of repeats over each language's corpus. We perform an extensive series of ablations testing a\nrange of sampling strategies on a suite of multilingual benchmarks, while varying model scale. We find that UniMax\noutperforms standard temperature-based sampling, and the benefits persist as scale increases. As part of our\ncontribution, we release: (i) an improved and refreshed mC4 multilingual corpus consisting of 29 trillion characters\nacross 107 languages, and (ii) a suite of pretrained umT5 model checkpoints trained with UniMax sampling.*\n\n# Integration into Transformers\n\nOverview of umT5 model integration:\n\n* Transformers Integration is on-going, see this awesome [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/22626) by @agemagician!\n* Conversion script (umT5X checkpoints to FLAX) is [here](https://gist.github.com/stefan-it/5d6a4ec89e7ad97181983881434cb4eb).", "size_bytes": "1226484573", "downloads": 14}
