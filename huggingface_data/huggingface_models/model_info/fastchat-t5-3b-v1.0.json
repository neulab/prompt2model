It can also be used for research purposes.\n\n**Primary intended users:**\nThe primary intended users of the model are entrepreneurs and researchers in natural language processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Training dataset\n70K conversations collected from ShareGPT.com.\n\n## Training details\nIt processes the ShareGPT data in the form of question answering. Each ChatGPT response is processed as an answer, and previous conversations between the user and the ChatGPT are processed as the question.\nThe encoder bi-directionally encodes a question into a hidden representation. The decoder uses cross-attention to attend to this representation while generating an answer uni-directionally from a start token.\nThis model is fine-tuned for 3 epochs, with a max learning rate 2e-5, warmup ratio 0.03, and a cosine learning rate schedule. \n\n## Evaluation dataset\nA preliminary evaluation of the model quality is conducted by creating a set of 80 diverse questions and utilizing GPT-4 to judge the model outputs.
