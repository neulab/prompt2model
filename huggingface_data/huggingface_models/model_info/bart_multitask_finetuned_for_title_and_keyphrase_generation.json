First, we create a training set containing comma-separated lists of keyphrases and titles as text generation targets. For this purpose, we form text-title and text-keyphrases pairs based on the original text corpus. Second, we append each source text in the training set with control codes <|TITLE|> and <|KEYPHRASES|> respectively. After that, the training set is shuffled in random order. Finally, the preprocessed training set is utilized to fine-tune the pre-trained BART model.\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"beogradjanka/bart_multitask_finetuned_for_title_and_keyphrase_generation\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"beogradjanka/bart_multitask_finetuned_for_title_and_keyphrase_generation\")\n\n\ntext = \"In this paper, we investigate cross-domain limitations of keyphrase generation using the models for abstractive text summarization.\\\n        We present an evaluation of BART fine-tuned for keyphrase generation across three types of texts, \\\n        namely scientific texts from computer science and biomedical domains and news texts. \\\n        We explore the role of transfer learning between different domains to improve the model performance on small text corpora.\"\n\n#generating \\n-separated keyphrases\ntokenized_text = tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch([\"<|KEYPHRASES|> \" + text], return_tensors='pt')\ntranslation = model.generate(**tokenized_text)\ntranslated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translation, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nprint(translated_text)\n\n#generating title\ntokenized_text = tokenizer.prepare_seq2seq_batch([\"<|TITLE|> \" + text], return_tensors='pt')\ntranslation = model.generate(**tokenized_text)\ntranslated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(translation, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]\nprint(translated_text)\n```\n\n#### Training Hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n\n* learning_rate: 4e-5\n* train_batch_size: 8\n* optimizer: AdamW with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n* num_epochs: 3\n\n**BibTeX:**\n\n```\n@INPROCEEDINGS{10139061,\n  author={Glazkova, Anna and Morozov, Dmitry},\n  booktitle={2023 IX International Conference on Information Technology and Nanotechnology (ITNT)}, \n  title={Multi-task fine-tuning for generating keyphrases in a scientific domain}, \n  year={2023},\n  pages={1-5},\n  doi={10.1109/ITNT57377.2023.10139061}}\n\n```", "size_bytes": "557971229", "downloads": 12}
