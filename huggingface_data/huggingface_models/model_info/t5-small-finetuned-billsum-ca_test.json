The\\\n    \\ Legislature hereby finds and declares as follows: (a) Many areas of the state\\\n    \\ are disproportionately impacted by drought because they are heavily dependent\\\n    \\ or completely reliant on groundwater from basins that are in overdraft and in\\\n    \\ which the water table declines year after year or from basins that are contaminated.\\\n    \\ (b) There are a number of state grant and loan programs that provide financial\\\n    \\ assistance to communities to address drinking water and wastewater needs. Unfortunately,\\\n    \\ there is no program in place to provide similar assistance to individual homeowners\\\n    \\ who are reliant on their own groundwater wells and who may not be able to afford\\\n    \\ conventional private loans to undertake vital water supply, water quality, and\\\n    \\ wastewater improvements. (c) The program created by this act is intended to\\\n    \\ bridge that gap by providing low-interest loans, grants, or both, to individual\\\n    \\ homeowners to undertake actions necessary to provide safer, cleaner, and more\\\n    \\ reliable drinking water and wastewater treatment. These actions may include,\\\n    \\ but are not limited to, digging deeper wells, improving existing wells and related\\\n    \\ equipment, addressing drinking water contaminants in the homeowner\\u2019s water,\\\n    \\ or connecting to a local water or wastewater system. SEC. 2. Chapter 6.6 (commencing\\\n    \\ with Section 13486) is added to Division 7 of the Water Code, to read: CHAPTER\\\n    \\  6.6. Water and Wastewater Loan and Grant Program 13486. (a) The board shall\\\n    \\ establish a program in accordance with this chapter to provide low-interest\\\n    \\ loans and grants to local agencies for low-interest loans and grants to eligible\\\n    \\ applicants for any of the following purposes:\"\n  example_title: Water use\n- text: \"The people of the State of California do enact as follows:   SECTION 1.
