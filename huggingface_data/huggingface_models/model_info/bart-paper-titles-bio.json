This model is specifically tuned for biology and \nmedicine papers.\n\nThis model is the result of a fine-tuning process done on [sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6).\nWe performed a first fine-tuning epoch on CSPubSumm (Ed Collins, et al. \"A supervised approach to extractive summarisation of scientific papers.\"), \nBIOPubSumm, and AIPubSumm (L. Cagliero, M. La Quatra \"Extracting highlights of scientific articles: A supervised summarization approach.\").\n\nA second fine-tuning epoch was performed only on BIOPubSumm to let the model better understand how biology and medicine titles are composed.\n\nYou can find more details in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicolovergaro/DNLP_project).\n\n# Usage\nThis checkpoint should be loaded into `BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained`. See the \n[BART docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart#transformers.BartForConditionalGeneration) for more information.\n\n# Metrics\nWe have tested the model on all three the test sets, with the following results:\n\n|   Dataset  | Rouge-1 F1 | Rouge-2 F1 | Rouge-L F1 | BERTScore F1 |\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|\n| BIOPubSumm |   0.45979  |   0.25406  |   0.39607  |    0.90272   |\n|  AIPubSumm |   0.44455  |   0.23214  |   0.35779  |    0.90721   |\n|  CSPubSumm |   0.49769  |   0.30773  |   0.43376  |    0.91561   |", "size_bytes": "1222361081", "downloads": 3}
