It is trained as part of BOUN-TABI system for the Social Media Mining for Health (SMM4H) 2022 shared task. The system description paper has been accepted for publication in *Proceedings of the Seventh Social Media Mining for Health (#SMM4H) Workshop and Shared Task* and will be available soon. The source code has been released on GitHub at [https://github.com/gokceuludogan/boun-tabi-smm4h22](https://github.com/gokceuludogan/boun-tabi-smm4h22).\n\nThe model utilizes the T5 model and its text-to-text formulation. The inputs are fed to the model with the task prefix \"assert ade:\", followed with a sentence/tweet. In turn, the output \"adverse event problem\" or \"healthy okay\" is received. \n\n## Requirements\n```\nsentencepiece\ntransformers\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"yirmibesogluz/t2t-assert-ade-balanced\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"yirmibesogluz/t2t-assert-ade-balanced\")\npredictor = pipeline(\"text2text-generation\", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)\npredictor(\"assert ade: joints killing me now i have gone back up on the lamotrigine. sick of side effects. sick of meds. want my own self back. knackered today\")\n```\n\n## Citation\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{uludogan-gokce-yirmibesoglu-zeynep-2022-boun-tabi-smm4h22,\n    title = \"{BOUN}-{TABI}@{SMM4H}'22: Text-to-{T}ext {A}dverse {D}rug {E}vent {E}xtraction with {D}ata {B}alancing and {P}rompting\",\n    author = \"Uludo{\\u{g}}an, G{\\\"{o}}k{\\c{c}}e  and Yirmibe{\\c{s}}o{\\u{g}}lu, Zeynep\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the Seventh Social Media Mining for Health ({\\#}SMM4H) Workshop and Shared Task\",\n    year = \"2022\",\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "891737405", "downloads": 5}
