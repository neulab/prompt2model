The model was introduced in the paper [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07916.pdf) by Guo et al. and first released in [the LongT5 repository](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). All the model architecture and configuration can be found in [Flaxformer repository](https://github.com/google/flaxformer) which uses another Google research project repository [T5x](https://github.com/google-research/t5x).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing LongT5 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\nLongT5 model is an encoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting ([Pegasus-like generation pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf)). LongT5 model is an extension of [T5 model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf), and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2) Transient-Global attention. The usage of attention sparsity patterns allows the model to efficiently handle input sequence.\n\nLongT5 is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (summarization, question answering) which requires handling long input sequences (up to 16,384 tokens).\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model is mostly meant to be fine-tuned on a supervised dataset. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=longt5) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to use\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, LongT5Model\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/long-t5-local-large\")\nmodel = LongT5Model.from_pretrained(\"google/long-t5-local-large\")\n\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\noutputs = model(**inputs)\n\nlast_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state\n```\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{guo2021longt5,\n  title={LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences},\n  author={Guo, Mandy and Ainslie, Joshua and Uthus, David and Ontanon, Santiago and Ni, Jianmo and Sung, Yun-Hsuan and Yang, Yinfei},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.07916},\n  year={2021}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "3001185895", "downloads": 362}
