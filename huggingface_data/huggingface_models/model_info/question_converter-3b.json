(2018).\n\nWhere a is answer, q is question, and d is declerative sentence (i.e. a statement).\n\nSee Appendex B.2 of Chen et al. for more.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe prompt should be `{question} {seperator} {answer}` where the seperator is `</s>`.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer,  AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('domenicrosati/question_converter-3b')\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained('domenicrosati/question_converter-3b')\n\nquestion = \"Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?\"\nanswer = \"She is in Abruzzo\"\n\nprompt = f'{question} </s> {answer}'\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').input_ids\noutput_ids = model.generate(input_ids)\nresponses = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n```\n> `['Carmen Sandiego is in Abruzzo.']`\n", "size_bytes": "11406622919", "downloads": 9}
