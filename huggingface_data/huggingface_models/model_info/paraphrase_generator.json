You can do this by prepending the following to the input text:\n\n\n```\nParaphrase: {distance_keyword} changes, {word_length_keyword} input.\n```\n\n### distance_keyword\nThis tells the model how much to change the input text. There are four options: \n1. small\n2. medium\n3. large\n4. gigantic\n\n### word_length_keyword:\nTells the model how long to make the output text relative to the input. There are three options:\n1. reduce\n2. match\n3. expand\n\nIf you only want to paraphrase and don't necessarily care about the specifics of the output, you can also prepend \"Paraphrase: \" alone or skip the prepending all together and just input the text you wish to paraphrase.\n\n## How to use:\n\nInitializing model using GPU and Bfloat16 precision:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline \nfrom torch import bfloat16\n\npara_gen = pipeline('text2text-generation', model=\"imjeffhi/paraphrase_generator\", tokenizer=\"imjeffhi/paraphrase_generator\", device=0, torch_dtype=bfloat16)\n```\n\nCalling model: \n\n```python\noptions_phrase = \"Paraphrase: large changes, match input.\"\ninput_text = \"A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words.\"\noutput = para_gen(f\"{options_phrase} {input_text}\", do_sample=True, top_k=10, num_return_sequences=5)\n```\nOutput: \n```python\n[{'generated_text': 'A paraphrase is a modification of the meaning or expression of a text or passage by using other words.'},\n {'generated_text': 'A paraphrase is a continuation of the meaning of a text or a passage using other words.'},\n {'generated_text': 'A paraphrase is the restatement of the meaning of a text or other passage containing other words.'},\n {'generated_text': 'The paraphrase is a repetition of the meanings of a text or passage using other words.'},\n {'generated_text': 'A paraphrase is a continuation of a sentence or passage by using other words.'}]\n```\n", "size_bytes": "990408885", "downloads": 3}
