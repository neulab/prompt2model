The model has been fed series of 11-grams extracted from eLAEME\ncorpus and prefixed with \"Lemmatize: \". It is not intended to serve as general\nlemmatizer for all sorts of Middle English texts because eLAEME employes bespoke\ntranscription rules that diverge from your regular transcript rules.\n\nThe `manx` package that you can use the model with can be found here:\n`https://github.com/mdm-code/manx`. The package will give a more general look\nat the data used to fine-tune the model. It lets you download corpus files, parse\nthem and get them ready for fine-tuning the base model checkpoint.\nIt has links to Colab notebook and ready-made API that lets you feed\ntexts to have them lemmatized.\n\nMake sure to reference this Huggingface repository\n(`https://huggingface.co/mdm-code/me-lemmatize-byt5-small`) and the Github\nrepository (`https://github.com/mdm-code/manx`) for `manx` whenever you use\nthis model for your own research.
