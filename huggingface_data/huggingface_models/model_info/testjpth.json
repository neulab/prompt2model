I use NLLB for this model.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis is just for the test concept of NLLB model\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThe data was generated by other model. The dataset was split by intention to use in order to make the model understand some technical term.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 2e-05\n- train_batch_size: 1\n- eval_batch_size: 1\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 1\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.30.2\n- Pytorch 2.0.1+cu118\n- Datasets 2.13.1\n- Tokenizers 0.13.3", "size_bytes": "2468874377", "downloads": 4}
