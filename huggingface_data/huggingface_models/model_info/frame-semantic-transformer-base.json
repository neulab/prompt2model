{"pretrained_model_name": "chanind/frame-semantic-transformer-base", "description": "---\nlicense: apache-2.0\n---\n\nFine-tuned T5 base model for use as a frame semantic parser in the [Frame Semantic Transformer](https://github.com/chanind/frame-semantic-transformer) project. This model is trained on data from [FrameNet 1.7](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/).\n\n### Usage\nThis is meant to be used a part of [Frame Semantic Transformer](https://github.com/chanind/frame-semantic-transformer). See that project for usage instructions.\n\n### Tasks\n\nThis model is trained to perform 3 tasks related to semantic frame parsing:\n1. Identify frame trigger locations in the text\n2. Classify the frame given a trigger location\n3. Extract frame elements in the sentence\n\n### Performance\n\nThis model is trained and evaluated using the same train/dev/test splits from FrameNet 1.7 annotated corpora as used by [Open Sesame](https://github.com/swabhs/open-sesame). \n\n| Task                   | F1 Score (Dev) | F1 Score (Test) |\n| ---------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |\n| Trigger identification | 0.78           | 0.74            |\n| Frame Classification   | 0.91           | 0.89            |\n| Argument Extraction    | 0.78           | 0.75            |\n", "size_bytes": "891697151", "downloads": 208}
