Download  ```MathT5.py```.\n2. ```from MathT5 import load_model, inference```\n3. ```tokenizer, model = load_model(\"jmeadows17/MathT5-base\")```\n4. ```inference(prompt, tokenizer, model)```\n\n```MathT5.pretty_print(text, prompt=True)``` makes prompts and outputs (```prompt=False```) easier to read.\n\n**Overview**\n\nMathT5-base is a version of T5-base (_not FLAN-T5_) that is fine-tuned for 25 epochs on 15K (LaTeX) synthetic mathematical derivations (containing 4 - 10 equations), that were generated using a symbolic solver (SymPy). Paper available here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09998.\n\n\n**Example prompt:**\n\n```prompt = \"Given \\\\cos{(q)} = \\\\theta{(q)},\nthen derive - \\\\sin{(q)} = \\\\frac{d}{d q} \\\\theta{(q)},\nthen obtain (- \\\\sin{(q)})^{q} (\\\\frac{d}{d q} \\\\cos{(q)})^{q} = (- \\\\sin{(q)})^{2 q}\"```\n\nOutput derivations are equations separated by \"and\".\n\nAdditional prompts can be found in \"training_prompts.json\" alongside the model files.\n\nFor the large version based on FLAN-T5 use ```\"jmeadows17/MathT5-large\"```.", "size_bytes": "891629201", "downloads": 22}
