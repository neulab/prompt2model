In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales with model size and performs competitively with open-domain systems that explicitly retrieve answers from an external knowledge source when answering questions. To facilitate reproducibility and future work, we release our code and trained models at https://goo.gle/t5-cbqa.\n\n![model image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickvonplaten/scientific_images/master/how_much_know_ledge_image.png)", "size_bytes": "11399285375", "downloads": 47}
