The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\"\n---\n\n# Paper Title Generator\n\nGenerates titles for computer science papers given an abstract.\n\nThe model is a BERT2BERT Encoder-Decoder using the official `bert-base-uncased` checkpoint as initialization for the encoder and decoder.\nIt was fine-tuned on 318,500 computer science papers posted on arXiv.org between 2007 and 2022 and achieved a 26.3% Rouge2 F1-Score on held-out validation data.\n\n**Live Demo:** [https://paper-titles.ey.r.appspot.com/](https://paper-titles.ey.r.appspot.com/)", "size_bytes": "989679019", "downloads": 679}
