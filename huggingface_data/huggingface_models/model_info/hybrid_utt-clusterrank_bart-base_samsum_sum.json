Also, unlike news articles and documents with well-structured text, dialogue differs in the sense that it often comes from two or more interlocutors, exchanging information with each other and having an inherent hierarchical structure based on the sequence of utterances by different speakers. This paper proposes a simple but effective hybrid approach that consists of two modules and uses transfer learning by leveraging pretrained language models (PLMs) to generate an abstractive summary. The first module highlights important utterances, capturing the utterance level relationship by adapting an auto-encoding model like BERT based on the unsupervised or supervised method. And then, the second module generates a concise abstractive summary by adapting encoder-decoder models like T5, BART, and PEGASUS. Experiment results on benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance by adapting to dialogue scenarios and can also be helpful in low-resource settings for domain adaptation.\n\n*Rohit Sroch. 2021.
