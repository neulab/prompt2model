The model was introduced in the paper [LongT5: Efficient Text-To-Text Transformer for Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07916.pdf) by Guo et al. and first released in [the LongT5 repository](https://github.com/google-research/longt5). All the model architecture and configuration can be found in [Flaxformer repository](https://github.com/google/flaxformer) which uses another Google research project repository [T5x](https://github.com/google-research/t5x).\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing LongT5 did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by the Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\nLongT5 model is an encoder-decoder transformer pre-trained in a text-to-text denoising generative setting ([Pegasus-like generation pre-training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf)). LongT5 model is an extension of [T5 model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf), and it enables using one of the two different efficient attention mechanisms - (1) Local attention, or (2) Transient-Global attention. The usage of attention sparsity patterns allows the model to efficiently handle input sequence.\n\nLongT5 is particularly effective when fine-tuned for text generation (summarization, question answering) which requires handling long input sequences (up to 16,384 tokens).\n\nResults of LongT5 (transient-global attention, large-sized model) fine-tuned on multiple (summarization, QA) tasks.\n\n| Dataset | Rouge-1 | Rouge-2 | Rouge-Lsum |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| arXiv (16k input) | 48.28 | 21.63 | 44.11 |\n| PubMed (16k input) | 49.98 | 24.69 | 46.46 |\n| BigPatent (16k input) | 70.38 | 56.81 | 62.73 |\n| MultiNews (8k input) | 47.18 | 18.44 | 24.18 |\n| MediaSum (4k input) | 35.54 | 19.04 | 32.20 |\n| CNN / DailyMail (4k input) | 42.49 | 20.51 | 40.18 |\n\n| Dataset | EM | F1 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Natural Questions (4k input) | 60.77 | 65.38 |\n| Trivia QA (16k input) | 78.38 | 82.45 |\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model is mostly meant to be fine-tuned on a supervised dataset.
