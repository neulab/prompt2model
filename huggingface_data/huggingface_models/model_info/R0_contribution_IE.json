Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Besides, implementation of efficient public health policies could help flattens the epidemic curve.\"\n---\n\n\nThis model is a fine-tuned version of google/flan-t5-large on scholarly articles in virology.\nIt produces structured summaries in JSON format from paper's context (title and abstract) for the research theme \"R0 value on infectious diseases\".", "size_bytes": "3132793669", "downloads": 9}
