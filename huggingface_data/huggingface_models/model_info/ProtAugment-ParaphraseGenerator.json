It has been trained on a mix of 3 different paraphrase detection datasets: MSR, Quora, Google-PAWS.\n\nWe use this model in our ACL'21 Paper [\"PROTAUGMENT: Unsupervised diverse short-texts paraphrasing for intent detection meta-learning\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12995)\n\nJointly used with generation constraints, this model allows to generate diverse paraphrases. We use those paraphrases as a data augmentation technique to further boosts a classification model's generalization capability. Feel free to play with the [code](https://github.com/tdopierre/ProtAugment)!\n\nIf you use this model, please consider citing our paper.\n```\n@article{Dopierre2021ProtAugmentUD,\n    title={ProtAugment: Unsupervised diverse short-texts paraphrasing for intent detection meta-learning},\n    author={Thomas Dopierre and C.
