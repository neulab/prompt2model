Flacuna is better than Vicuna at problem-solving. Access the model here [https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flacuna-13b-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flacuna-13b-v1.0).\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Curious to know the performance of \ud83c\udf6e \ud83e\udd99 **Flan-Alpaca** on large-scale LLM evaluation benchmark, **InstructEval**? Read our paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04757.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04757.pdf). We evaluated more than 10 open-source instruction-tuned LLMs belonging to various LLM families including Pythia, LLaMA, T5, UL2, OPT, and Mosaic. Codes and datasets: [https://github.com/declare-lab/instruct-eval](https://github.com/declare-lab/instruct-eval)\n\n\n\ud83d\udce3 **FLAN-T5** is also useful in text-to-audio generation. Find our work at [https://github.com/declare-lab/tango](https://github.com/declare-lab/tango) if you are interested.\n\n\nOur [repository](https://github.com/declare-lab/flan-alpaca) contains code for extending the [Stanford Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)\nsynthetic instruction tuning to existing instruction-tuned models such as [Flan-T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416).\nWe have a [live interactive demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joaogante/transformers_streaming) thanks to [Joao Gante](https://huggingface.co/joaogante)!\nWe are also benchmarking many instruction-tuned models at [declare-lab/flan-eval](https://github.com/declare-lab/flan-eval).\nOur pretrained models are fully available on HuggingFace \ud83e\udd17 :\n\n| Model                                                                            | Parameters | Instruction Data                                                                                                                                   | Training GPUs   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| [Flan-Alpaca-Base](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-base)          | 220M       | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)                                            | 1x A6000        |\n| [Flan-Alpaca-Large](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-large)        | 770M       | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)                                            | 1x A6000        |\n| [Flan-Alpaca-XL](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xl)              | 3B         | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)                                            | 1x A6000        |\n| [Flan-Alpaca-XXL](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-xxl)            | 11B        | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)                                            | 4x A6000 (FSDP) |\n| [Flan-GPT4All-XL](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-gpt4all-xl)            | 3B         | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [GPT4All](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all)                                                    | 1x A6000        |\n| [Flan-ShareGPT-XL](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-sharegpt-xl)          | 3B         | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [ShareGPT](https://github.com/domeccleston/sharegpt)/[Vicuna](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat) | 1x A6000        |\n| [Flan-Alpaca-GPT4-XL*](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/flan-alpaca-gpt4-xl)   | 3B         | [Flan](https://github.com/google-research/FLAN), [GPT4-Alpaca](https://github.com/Instruction-Tuning-with-GPT-4/GPT-4-LLM)                         | 1x A6000        |\n\n*recommended for better performance\n\n### Why?\n\n[Alpaca](https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html) represents an exciting new direction\nto approximate the performance of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT cheaply and easily.\nConcretely, they leverage an LLM such as GPT-3 to generate instructions as synthetic training data.\nThe synthetic data which covers more than 50k tasks can then be used to finetune a smaller model.\nHowever, the original implementation is less accessible due to licensing constraints of the\nunderlying [LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) model.\nFurthermore, users have noted [potential noise](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/65) in the synthetic\ndataset. Hence, it may be better to explore a fully accessible model that is already trained on high-quality (but\nless diverse) instructions such as [Flan-T5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416).\n\n### Usage\n\n```\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nprompt = \"Write an email about an alpaca that likes flan\"\nmodel = pipeline(model=\"declare-lab/flan-alpaca-gpt4-xl\")\nmodel(prompt, max_length=128, do_sample=True)\n\n# Dear AlpacaFriend,\n# My name is Alpaca and I'm 10 years old.\n# I'm excited to announce that I'm a big fan of flan!\n# We like to eat it as a snack and I believe that it can help with our overall growth.\n# I'd love to hear your feedback on this idea. \n# Have a great day! \n# Best, AL Paca\n```", "size_bytes": "990404917", "downloads": 4848}
