Liu* and here is the abstract:\n\nTransfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.\n\n### Details of the downstream task (Summarization) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda\n\n- The summarization data has been taken from [Inshorts News Data](https://www.kaggle.com/shashichander009/inshorts-news-data) from kaggle. Inshorts is a news service that provides short summaries of news from around the web. This dataset contains headlines and summary of news items along with its source.\n\n\n### Model training\n\nThe training script is present [here](https://github.com/lordtt13/transformers-experiments/blob/master/Custom%20Tasks/fine-tune-t5-for-summarization.ipynb).\n\n### Pipelining the Model\n\n```python\nimport transformers\n\nmodel = transformers.T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('lordtt13/t5-inshorts')\n\ntokenizer = transformers.T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"lordtt13/t5-inshorts\")\n\nnlp_fill = transformers.pipeline('summarization', model = model, tokenizer = tokenizer)\nnlp_fill('The CBI on Saturday booked four former officials of Syndicate Bank and six others for cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing \u20b9209 crore loss to the state-run bank.
