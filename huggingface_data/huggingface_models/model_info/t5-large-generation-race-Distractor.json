This is the second component in the question generation pipeline (i.e. `g2`) in our [MQAG paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12307), \nor please refer to the GitHub repo of this project: https://github.com/potsawee/mqag0.\n\n## How to Use the Model\n\nUse the code below to get started with the model. \n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"potsawee/t5-large-generation-race-Distractor\")\n>>> model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"potsawee/t5-large-generation-race-Distractor\")\n\n>>> context = r\"\"\"\n...

The United States has extended \n... its requirement for international visitors to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
