Liu* in Here the abstract:\n\nTransfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.\n\n![model image](https://i.imgur.com/jVFMMWR.png)\n\n## Details of the downstream task (Summarization) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda\n\n[News Summary](https://www.kaggle.com/sunnysai12345/news-summary)\n\nThe dataset consists of **4515 examples** and contains Author_name, Headlines, Url of Article, Short text, Complete Article. I gathered the summarized news from Inshorts and only scraped the news articles from Hindu, Indian times and Guardian. Time period ranges from febrauary to august 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Model fine-tuning \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\n\nThe training script is a slightly modified version of [this Colab Notebook](https://github.com/abhimishra91/transformers-tutorials/blob/master/transformers_summarization_wandb.ipynb) created by [Abhishek Kumar Mishra](https://github.com/abhimishra91), so all credits to him!\nI also trained the model for more epochs (6).\n\n\n## Model in Action \ud83d\ude80\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelWithLMHead, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-summarize-news\")\nmodel = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained(\"mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-summarize-news\")\n\ndef summarize(text, max_length=150):\n  input_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors=\"pt\", add_special_tokens=True)\n\n  generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids=input_ids, num_beams=2, max_length=max_length,  repetition_penalty=2.5, length_penalty=1.0, early_stopping=True)\n\n  preds = [tokenizer.decode(g, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True) for g in generated_ids]\n\n  return preds[0]\n```\nGiven the following article from **NYT** (2020/06/09) with title *George Floyd\u2019s death energized a movement. He will be buried in Houston today*:\n\nAfter the sound and the fury, weeks of demonstrations and anguished calls for racial justice, the man whose death gave rise to an international movement, and whose last words \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2014 have been a rallying cry, will be laid to rest on Tuesday at a private funeral in Houston.George Floyd, who was 46, will then be buried in a grave next to his mother\u2019s.The service, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. at the Fountain of Praise church, comes after five days of public memorials in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston and two weeks after a Minneapolis police officer was caught on video pressing his knee into Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes before Mr. Floyd died. That officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. His bail was set at $1.25 million in a court appearance on Monday. The outpouring of anger and outrage after Mr. Floyd\u2019s death \u2014 and the speed at which protests spread from tense, chaotic demonstrations in the city where he died to an international movement from Rome to Rio de Janeiro \u2014 has reflected the depth of frustration borne of years of watching black people die at the hands of the police or vigilantes while calls for change went unmet.\n```\nsummarize('After the sound and the fury, weeks of demonstrations and anguished calls for racial justice, the man whose death gave rise to an international movement, and whose last words \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2014 have been a rallying cry, will be laid to rest on Tuesday at a private funeral in Houston.George Floyd, who was 46, will then be buried in a grave next to his mother\u2019s.The service, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. at the Fountain of Praise church, comes after five days of public memorials in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston and two weeks after a Minneapolis police officer was caught on video pressing his knee into Mr. Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes before Mr. Floyd died.
