Shifts in dietary patterns can therefore potentially provide benefits for both the environment and health. However, there is uncertainty about the magnitude of these impacts, and the dietary changes necessary to achieve them. We systematically review the evidence on changes in GHG emissions, land use, and water use, from shifting current dietary intakes to environ- mentally sustainable dietary patterns. We find 14 common sustainable dietary patterns across reviewed studies, with reductions as high as 70\u201380% of GHG emissions and land use, and 50% of water use (with medians of about 20\u201330% for these indicators across all studies) possible by adopting sustainable dietary patterns. Reductions in environmental footprints were generally proportional to the magnitude of animal-based food restriction. Dietary shifts also yielded modest benefits in all-cause mortality risk. Our review reveals that environmental and health benefits are possible by shifting current Western diets to a variety of more sustainable dietary patterns.\"\n    summarizer(article)\n## Results\n| key | value |\n| --- | ----- |\n| eval_rouge1 | 41.3889 |\n| eval_rouge2 | 13.3641 |\n| eval_rougeL | 24.3154 |\n| eval_rougeLsum | 36.612 |\n| test_rouge1 | 41.4786 |\n| test_rouge2 | 13.3787 |\n| test_rougeL | 24.1558 |\n| test_rougeLsum | 36.7723 |\n", "size_bytes": "1625541389", "downloads": 43}
