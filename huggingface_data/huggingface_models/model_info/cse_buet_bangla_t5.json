This is a sequence to sequence transformer model pretrained with the [\"Span Corruption\"]() objective. Finetuned models using this checkpoint achieve state-of-the-art results on many of the NLG tasks in bengali. \n\nFor finetuning on different downstream tasks such as `Machine Translation`, `Abstractive Text Summarization`, `Question Answering` etc., refer to the scripts in the official GitHub [repository](https://github.com/csebuetnlp/BanglaNLG).\n\n**Note**: This model was pretrained using a specific normalization pipeline available [here](https://github.com/csebuetnlp/normalizer). All finetuning scripts in the official GitHub repository use this normalization by default. If you need to adapt the pretrained model for a different task make sure the text units are normalized using this pipeline before tokenizing to get best results. A basic example is given below:\n\n## Using this model in `transformers` (tested on 4.11.0.dev0)\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\nfrom normalizer import normalize # pip install git+https://github.com/csebuetnlp/normalizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"csebuetnlp/banglat5\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"csebuetnlp/banglat5\", use_fast=False)\n\ninput_sentence = \"\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(normalize(input_sentence), return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\ngenerated_tokens = model.generate(input_ids)\ndecoded_tokens = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_tokens)[0]\n\nprint(decoded_tokens)\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\n \n* Supervised fine-tuning\n\n|     Model          |   Params   |     MT (SacreBLEU)    |      TS (ROUGE-2)     |      QA (EM/F1)   |   MD (SacreBLEU-1)  |  NHG (ROUGE-2) |  XLS (ROUGE-2) |   BNLG score |\n|--------------------|------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|\n|[mT5 (base)](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-base) | 582M  | 36.6/22.5 | 10.3 | 59.0/65.3 | 17.5 |  9.6 | 2.7/0.7 | 24.9 |\n|[XLM-ProphetNet](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/xprophetnet-large-wiki100-cased) | 616M | 23.3/16.4 | 7.8 | 53.0/57.3 | 20.0 | 9.5 | 6.2/2.7 | 21.8 |\n|[mBART-50](https://huggingface.co/facebook/mbart-large-50) | 611M | 23.6/16.7 | 10.4 | 53.4/58.9 | 18.5 | 11.2 | 5.4/3.7 | 22.4 |\n|[IndicBART](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/IndicBART) | 244M | 22.7/13.1 | 8.1 | 53.3/58.8 | 14.8 | 7.9 | 6.3/2.5 | 20.8 |\n|[BanglaT5](https://huggingface.co/csebuetnlp/banglat5) | 247M | 38.8/25.2 | 13.7 | 68.5/74.8 | 19.0 | 13.8 | 6.4/4.0 | 29.4 |\n\n\nThe benchmarking datasets are as follows:\n* **MT:** **[Machine Translation](https://github.com/csebuetnlp/banglanmt#datasets)**\n* **TS:** **[Abstractive Text Summarization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csebuetnlp/xlsum)**\n* **QA:** **[Question Answering](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csebuetnlp/squad_bn)**\n* **MD:** **[Multi Turn Dialogue Generation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qPmNN6qA4evbh4cD_BDDTCFOwMu4H2JS/view?usp=sharing)**\n* **NHG:** **[News Headline Generation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csebuetnlp/xlsum)**\n* **XLS:** **[Cross-lingual Summarization](https://huggingface.co/datasets/csebuetnlp/CrossSum)**\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use this model, please cite the following paper:\n```\n@article{bhattacharjee2022banglanlg,\n  author    = {Abhik Bhattacharjee and Tahmid Hasan and Wasi Uddin Ahmad and Rifat Shahriyar},\n  title     = {BanglaNLG: Benchmarks and Resources for Evaluating Low-Resource Natural Language Generation in Bangla},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/2205.11081},\n  year      = {2022},\n  url       = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11081},\n  eprinttype = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {2205.11081}\n}\n```\n\n\nIf you use the normalization module, please cite the following paper:\n```\n@inproceedings{hasan-etal-2020-low,\n    title = \"Not Low-Resource Anymore: Aligner Ensembling, Batch Filtering, and New Datasets for {B}engali-{E}nglish Machine Translation\",\n    author = \"Hasan, Tahmid  and\n      Bhattacharjee, Abhik  and\n      Samin, Kazi  and\n      Hasan, Masum  and\n      Basak, Madhusudan  and\n      Rahman, M.

Most publicly available parallel corpora for Bengali are not large enough; and have rather poor quality, mostly because of incorrect sentence alignments resulting from erroneous sentence segmentation, and also because of a high volume of noise present in them. In this work, we build a customized sentence segmenter for Bengali and propose two novel methods for parallel corpus creation on low-resource setups: aligner ensembling and batch filtering. With the segmenter and the two methods combined, we compile a high-quality Bengali-English parallel corpus comprising of 2.75 million sentence pairs, more than 2 million of which were not available before. Training on neural models, we achieve an improvement of more than 9 BLEU score over previous approaches to Bengali-English machine translation. We also evaluate on a new test set of 1000 pairs made with extensive quality control. We release the segmenter, parallel corpus, and the evaluation set, thus elevating Bengali from its low-resource status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever large scale study on Bengali-English machine translation. We believe our study will pave the way for future research on Bengali-English machine translation as well as other low-resource languages.
