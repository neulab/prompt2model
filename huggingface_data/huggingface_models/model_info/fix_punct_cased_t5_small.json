Commans, periods, and semicolons were removed from the text and then random commas, periods, and semicolons were added. The model was trained to place those three punctuation marks in the correct location. The casing of the texts was not modified during training.\n\n\nIt achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 0.2744\n- Rouge1: 93.3712\n- Rouge2: 91.0027\n- Rougel: 93.3618\n- Rougelsum: 93.3479\n- Gen Len: 46.0728\n\n## Model description\n\nThe purpose of this model is to correct the punctuation in a sentence. For example, the phrase \"This is, a sentence. with odd punctuation to show off what, the model. can do\" gets changed to \"This is a sentence with odd punctuation to show off what the model can do.\"\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 8e-05\n- train_batch_size: 128\n- eval_batch_size: 256\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Rouge1  | Rouge2  | Rougel  | Rougelsum | Gen Len |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|\n| 1.2254        | 1.0   | 600  | 0.3501          | 63.2952 | 59.8766 | 63.137  | 63.2022   | 16.2637 |\n| 0.7345        | 2.0   | 1200 | 0.2815          | 64.896  | 61.6256 | 64.8677 | 64.8728   | 16.3625 |\n| 0.6536        | 3.0   | 1800 | 0.2744          | 64.8724 | 61.6282 | 64.8483 | 64.8502   | 16.3906 |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.22.2\n- Pytorch 1.11.0a0+17540c5\n- Datasets 2.5.1\n- Tokenizers 0.12.1\n", "size_bytes": "307793733", "downloads": 3}
