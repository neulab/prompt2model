This was trained for 3 epochs on the \"samsum\" dataset in order to summarise chat logs. \n\nThere are other models sizes available in this same series:\n * [ChatSum-Large (783M)](https://huggingface.co/KoalaAI/ChatSum-Large)\n * [ChatSum-Base (248M)](https://huggingface.co/KoalaAI/ChatSum-Base)\n\n## Intended Use\n\nThe model is intended to be used for generating summaries of chat logs. \nIt can be employed in a wide range of applications, including but not limited to chat analysis, conversation summarization, and dialogue-based content generation.\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model has been fine-tuned on the samsum dataset, which contains conversations between two or more participants. The dataset is in English, and each conversation is associated with a summary that captures the main points of the discussion.\n\n## Limitations and Ethical Considerations\n\nAs with any language model, the FLAN-T5-Small model has certain limitations and potential ethical considerations:\n\n1. **Limited Context Understanding**: The model's performance heavily relies on the context provided in the chat logs. It may not fully understand the nuances of the conversation, leading to occasional inaccuracies in the generated summaries.\n\n2. **Biases in Training Data**: The model's fine-tuning data (samsum dataset) may contain biases present in the original data source. This could lead to biased or unfair summaries being generated.\n\n3. **Privacy and Data Security**: If the chat logs used for summarization contain sensitive or private information, using this model may pose privacy risks, and proper data anonymization measures should be taken.\n\n4. **Responsibility in Use**: The model should be used responsibly, and the generated summaries should be carefully analyzed before making any critical decisions based on them.", "size_bytes": "307931461", "downloads": 11}
