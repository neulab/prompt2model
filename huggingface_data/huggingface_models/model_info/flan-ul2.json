[Citation](#citation)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFlan-UL2 is an encoder decoder model based on the `T5` architecture. It uses the same configuration as the [`UL2 model`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2)  released earlier last year. It was fine tuned using the \"Flan\" prompt tuning \nand dataset collection.\n\nAccording to the original [blog](https://www.yitay.net/blog/flan-ul2-20b) here are the notable improvements:\n- The original UL2 model was only trained with receptive field of 512, which made it non-ideal for N-shot prompting where N is large. \n- The Flan-UL2 checkpoint uses a receptive field of 2048 which makes it more usable for few-shot in-context learning.\n- The original UL2 model also had mode switch tokens that was rather mandatory to get good performance. However, they were a little cumbersome as this requires often some changes during inference or finetuning. In this update/change, we continue training UL2 20B for an additional 100k steps (with small batch) to forget \u201cmode tokens\u201d before applying Flan instruction tuning. This Flan-UL2 checkpoint does not require mode tokens anymore.\n\n# Using the model \n\n## Converting from T5x to huggingface\n\nYou can use the [`convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/t5/convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py) script and pass the argument `strict = False`. The final layer norm is missing from the original dictionnary, that is why we are passing the `strict = False` argument.\n```bash\npython convert_t5x_checkpoint_to_pytorch.py --t5x_checkpoint_path PATH_TO_T5X_CHECKPOINTS --config_file PATH_TO_CONFIG --pytorch_dump_path PATH_TO_SAVE\n```\nWe used the same config file as [`google/ul2`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2/blob/main/config.json).\n\n## Running the model\n\nFor more efficient memory usage, we advise you to load the model in `8bit` using `load_in_8bit` flag as follows (works only under GPU):\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers bitsandbytes\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\")\n\ninput_string = \"Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?\"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\nOtherwise, you can load and run the model in `bfloat16` as follows:\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate transformers\nfrom transformers import T5ForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")                                                                 \ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-ul2\")\n\ninput_string = \"Answer the following question by reasoning step by step. The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 for lunch, and bought 6 more, how many apple do they have?\"                                               \n\ninputs = tokenizer(input_string, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\noutputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=200)\n\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n# <pad> They have 23 - 20 = 3 apples left. They have 3 + 6 = 9 apples. Therefore, the answer is 9.</s>\n```\n\n# Results\n\n## Performance improvment \n\nThe reported results are the following : \n|  | MMLU | BBH | MMLU-CoT | BBH-CoT | Avg |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| FLAN-PaLM 62B | 59.6 | 47.5 | 56.9 | 44.9 | 49.9 |\n| FLAN-PaLM 540B | 73.5 | 57.9 | 70.9 | 66.3 | 67.2 |\n| FLAN-T5-XXL 11B | 55.1 | 45.3 | 48.6 | 41.4 | 47.6 |\n| FLAN-UL2 20B | 55.7(+1.1%) | 45.9(+1.3%) | 52.2(+7.4%) | 42.7(+3.1%) | 49.1(+3.2%) |\n\n\n# Introduction to UL2\n\nThis entire section has been copied from the [`google/ul2`](https://huggingface.co/google/ul2) model card and might be subject of change with respect to `flan-ul2`.\n\nUL2 is a unified framework for pretraining models that are universally effective across datasets and setups.

UL2 introduces a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes.\n\n![model image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/ul2.png)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nExisting pre-trained models are generally geared towards a particular class of problems. To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized and unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 and/or GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. Finally, by scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised NLP tasks ranging from language generation (with automated and human evaluation), language understanding, text classification, question answering, commonsense reasoning, long text reasoning, structured knowledge grounding and information retrieval. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. \n\nFor more information, please take a look at the original paper.\n\nPaper: [Unifying Language Learning Paradigms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05131v1)\n\nAuthors: *Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Vinh Q.

This means that the original training corpus is `C4`, \n\nIn \u201cScaling Instruction-Finetuned language models (Chung et al.)\u201d (also referred to sometimes as the Flan2 paper), the key idea is to train a large language model on a collection of datasets. These datasets are phrased as instructions which enable generalization across diverse tasks. Flan has been primarily trained on academic tasks. In Flan2, we released a series of T5 models ranging from 200M to 11B parameters that have been instruction tuned with Flan.\n\nThe Flan datasets have also been open sourced in \u201cThe Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning\u201d (Longpre et al.). See Google AI Blogpost: \u201cThe Flan Collection: Advancing Open Source Methods for Instruction Tuning\u201d. \n\n## UL2 PreTraining\n\nThe model is pretrained on the C4 corpus. For pretraining, the model is trained on a total of 1 trillion tokens on C4 (2 million steps)\nwith a batch size of 1024. The sequence length is set to 512/512 for inputs and targets. \nDropout is set to 0 during pretraining. Pre-training took slightly more than one month for about 1 trillion\ntokens. The model has 32 encoder layers and 32 decoder layers, `dmodel` of 4096 and `df` of 16384. \nThe dimension of each head is 256 for a total of 16 heads. Our model uses a model parallelism of 8. \nThe same sentencepiece tokenizer as T5 of vocab size 32000 is used (click [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5#transformers.T5Tokenizer) for more information about the T5 tokenizer).\n\nUL-20B can be interpreted as a model that is quite similar to T5 but trained with a different objective and slightly different scaling knobs. \nUL-20B was trained using the [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) infrastructure.\n\nThe training objective during pretraining is a mixture of different denoising strategies that are explained in the following:\n\n### Mixture of Denoisers\n\nTo quote the paper:\n> We conjecture that a strong universal model has to be exposed to solving diverse set of problems\n> during pre-training. Given that pre-training is done using self-supervision, we argue that such diversity\n> should be injected to the objective of the model, otherwise the model might suffer from lack a certain\n> ability, like long-coherent text generation.\n> Motivated by this, as well as current class of objective functions, we define three main paradigms that\n> are used during pre-training:\n\n- **R-Denoiser**: The regular denoising is the standard span corruption introduced in [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.20.0/en/model_doc/t5)\n that uses a range of 2 to 5 tokens as the span length, which masks about 15% of\ninput tokens. These spans are short and potentially useful to acquire knowledge instead of\nlearning to generate fluent text.\n\n- **S-Denoiser**: A specific case of denoising where we observe a strict sequential order when\nframing the inputs-to-targets task, i.e., prefix language modeling. To do so, we simply\npartition the input sequence into two sub-sequences of tokens as context and target such that\nthe targets do not rely on future information. This is unlike standard span corruption where\nthere could be a target token with earlier position than a context token. Note that similar to\nthe Prefix-LM setup, the context (prefix) retains a bidirectional receptive field. We note that\nS-Denoising with very short memory or no memory is in similar spirit to standard causal\nlanguage modeling.\n\n- **X-Denoiser**: An extreme version of denoising where the model must recover a large part\nof the input, given a small to moderate part of it. This simulates a situation where a model\nneeds to generate long target from a memory with relatively limited information. To do\nso, we opt to include examples with aggressive denoising where approximately 50% of the\ninput sequence is masked. This is by increasing the span length and/or corruption rate. We\nconsider a pre-training task to be extreme if it has a long span (e.g., \u2265 12 tokens) or have\na large corruption rate (e.g., \u2265 30%). X-denoising is motivated by being an interpolation\nbetween regular span corruption and language model like objectives.\n\nSee the following diagram for a more visual explanation:\n\n![mixture-of-denoisers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-research/google-research/master/ul2/figs/mod.png)\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 3.1.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nThe model was continously fine-tuned after N pretraining steps where N is typically from 50k to 100k.\nIn other words, after each Nk steps of pretraining, the model is finetuned on each downstream task. See section 5.2.2 of [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf) to get an overview of all datasets that were used for fine-tuning).\n\nAs the model is continuously finetuned, finetuning is stopped on a task once it has reached state-of-the-art to save compute.\nIn total, the model was trained for 2.65 million steps.\n\n**Important**: For more details, please see sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.05131v1.pdf).\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis model was originally contributed by [Yi Tay](https://www.yitay.net/?author=636616684c5e64780328eece), and added to the Hugging Face ecosystem by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) & [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).\n\n# Citation\n\nIf you want to cite this work, please consider citing the [blogpost](https://www.yitay.net/blog/flan-ul2-20b) announcing the release of `Flan-UL2`.", "size_bytes": 39708805120, "downloads": 71106}
