It establishes a **strong baseline** for automatically translating texts from Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 to English.  \n\nSpecifically, this model is a *byt5-base* model that was fine-tuned on  JW300 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 corpus and [Menyo-20k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/menyo20k_mt)\n\n#### Limitations and bias\nThis model is limited by its training dataset. This may not generalize well for all use cases in different domains.  \n## Training data\nThis model was fine-tuned on on  JW300 corpus and [Menyo-20k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/menyo20k_mt) dataset\n\n## Training procedure\nThis model was trained on NVIDIA V100 GPU\n\n## Eval results on Test set (BLEU score)\nFine-tuning byt5-base achieves 14.05 BLEU on [Menyo-20k test set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08647) while mt5-base achieves 15.57\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\nBy David Adelani\n```\n\n```\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "2326726857", "downloads": 12}
