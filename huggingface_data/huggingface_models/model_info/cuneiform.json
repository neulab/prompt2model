For example:\n\n```text\ntranslate Akkadian to English: 1(disz){d}szul3-ma-nu-_sag man gal?_-u2 _man_ dan-nu _man kisz_\n```\n\nThe network was trained to translate from the ancient languages:\n\n* Akkadian\n* Sumerian\n\nwritten in transcribed cuneiform to English.\n\nThe network requires a prompt telling it the direction of translation. For example:\n\n* `translate Akkadian to English: `\n* `translate English to Sumerian: `\n\n\n## Limitations\n\nIt was *not* trained to translate between the ancient languages but it is capable of it\n(`translate Sumerian to Akkadian: `). Buyer beware.\n\nIts vocabulary does not include \u0101, \u1e2b, \u012b, \u0159, \u0161, \u1e63, or \u016b so those letters are replaced with the unadorned letter (or \"sh\" in the case of \u0161 and \u1e63).\n", "size_bytes": "891697151", "downloads": 631}
