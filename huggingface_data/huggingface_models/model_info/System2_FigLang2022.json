Hypothesis: Yesterday I saw two gangs fighting right in front of my house and it totally didn't make me scared at all. What is the type of figurative language involved? Is there a contradiction or entailment between the premise and hypothesis?\"\n>>> input_ids = tokenizer.encode(input_string, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n>>> output = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200)\n>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)\n['Answer : [Type] Sarcasm [Label] Contradiction. Explanation : Seeing two gangs of people fighting in public can be really dangerous and scary, so someone who claims that they were not scared at all is being sarcastic.']\n```\n\n# More details about DREAM-FLUTE ...\nFor more details about DREAM-FLUTE, please refer to our:\n* \ud83d\udcc4Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16407\n* \ud83d\udcbbGitHub Repo: https://github.com/allenai/dream/ \n\nThis model is part of our DREAM-series of works. This is a line of research where we make use of scene elaboration for building a \"mental model\" of situation given in text. Check out our GitHub Repo for more!\n\n# More details about this model ...\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nWe use the FLUTE dataset for the FigLang2022SharedTask (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ColumbiaNLP/FLUTE) for training this model. \u223c7500 samples are provided as the training set. We used a 80-20 split to create our own training (6027 samples) and validation (1507 samples) partitions on which we build our models. For details on how we make use of the training data provided in the FigLang2022 shared task, please refer to https://github.com/allenai/dream/blob/main/FigLang2022SharedTask/Process_Data_Train_Dev_split.ipynb.\n\n## Model details\n\nThis model is a fine-tuned version of [t5-3b](https://huggingface.co/t5-3b).\n\nIt achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 0.6078\n- Rouge1: 62.8674\n- Rouge2: 45.0585\n- Rougel: 57.5618\n- Rougelsum: 57.5172\n- Gen Len: 50.7558\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 1\n- eval_batch_size: 1\n- seed: 42\n- distributed_type: multi-GPU\n- num_devices: 2\n- total_train_batch_size: 2\n- total_eval_batch_size: 2\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Rouge1  | Rouge2  | Rougel  | Rougelsum | Gen Len |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|\n| 0.8068        | 0.33  | 1000 | 0.7251          | 30.6353 | 25.0792 | 30.619  | 30.6274   | 19.0    |\n| 0.7276        | 0.66  | 2000 | 0.6715          | 30.8651 | 26.1492 | 30.8543 | 30.8519   | 19.0    |\n| 0.7063        | 1.0   | 3000 | 0.6338          | 31.0263 | 26.6749 | 31.0094 | 31.0098   | 19.0    |\n| 0.4516        | 1.33  | 4000 | 0.6447          | 30.9942 | 26.5984 | 30.9834 | 30.9778   | 19.0    |\n| 0.4538        | 1.66  | 5000 | 0.6183          | 31.0179 | 26.7012 | 31.005  | 31.0018   | 19.0    |\n| 0.4373        | 1.99  | 6000 | 0.6078          | 31.0085 | 26.7116 | 30.9952 | 30.9894   | 19.0    |\n| 0.2743        | 2.32  | 7000 | 0.6910          | 31.0051 | 26.7349 | 30.9975 | 30.9851   | 19.0    |\n| 0.2819        | 2.65  | 8000 | 0.6831          | 31.0876 | 26.848  | 31.0766 | 31.0753   | 19.0    |\n| 0.2849        | 2.99  | 9000 | 0.6673          | 30.9223 | 26.5899 | 30.9165 | 30.9073   | 19.0    |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.22.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.12.1+cu113\n- Datasets 2.4.0\n- Tokenizers 0.12.1\n", "size_bytes": 11800723456, "downloads": 3}
