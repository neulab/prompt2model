It outperforms others in terms of engagement and also feels more human, according to human evaluators.\n- The culmination of years of research in conversational AI, this is the first chatbot to blend a diverse set of conversational skills \u2014 including empathy, knowledge, and personality \u2014 together in one system.\n- We achieved this milestone through a new chatbot recipe that includes improved decoding techniques, novel blending of skills, and a model with 9.4 billion parameters, which is 3.6x more than the largest existing system.\n\n### Details of the downstream task (Summarization) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda\n\nA custom dataset was used, which was hand prepared by [SmokeTrees Digital](https://github.com/smoke-trees) AI engineers. This data contains long texts and summaries.\n\n### Model training\n\nThe training script is present [here](https://github.com/lordtt13/transformers-experiments/blob/master/Custom%20Tasks/fine-tune-blenderbot_small-for-summarization.ipynb).\n\n### Pipelining the Model\n\n```python\nmodel = transformers.BlenderbotSmallForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('lordtt13/blenderbot_small-news')\n\ntokenizer = transformers.BlenderbotSmallTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"lordtt13/blenderbot_small-news\")\n\nnlp_fill = transformers.pipeline('summarization', model = model, tokenizer = tokenizer)\nnlp_fill('The CBI on Saturday booked four former officials of Syndicate Bank and six others for cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing \u20b9209 crore loss to the state-run bank.
