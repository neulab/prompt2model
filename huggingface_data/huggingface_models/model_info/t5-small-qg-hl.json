The answer spans are highlighted within the text with special highlight tokens. \n\nYou can play with the model using the inference API, just highlight the answer spans with `<hl>` tokens and end the text with `</s>`. For example\n\n`<hl> 42 <hl> is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`\n\nFor more deatils see [this](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation) repo.\n\n### Model in action \ud83d\ude80\n\nYou'll need to clone the [repo](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation).\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patil-suraj/question_generation/blob/master/question_generation.ipynb)\n\n```python3\nfrom pipelines import pipeline\nnlp = pipeline(\"question-generation\")\nnlp(\"42 is the answer to life, universe and everything.\")\n=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, universe and everything?'}]\n```", "size_bytes": "242013444", "downloads": 1123}
