The model solves both, CoSQL's zero-shot text-to-SQL dialogue state tracking task and Spider's zero-shot text-to-SQL translation task. Zero-shot means that the model can generalize to unseen SQL databases.\n\n\n### Training Objective\n\nThis model was initialized with [t5.1.1.lm100k.large](https://github.com/google-research/text-to-text-transfer-transformer/blob/main/released_checkpoints.md#lm-adapted-t511lm100k) and fine-tuned with the text-to-text generation objective.\n\nA question is always grounded in both, a database schema and the preceiding questions in the dialogue. The model is trained to predict the SQL query that would be used to answer the user's current natural language question. The input to the model is composed of the user's current question, the database identifier, a list of tables and their columns, and a sequence of previous questions in reverse chronological order.\n\n```\n[current question] | [db_id] | [table] : [column] ( [content] , [content] ) , [column] ( ... ) , [...] | [table] : ... | ... || [previous question] | ... | [first question]\n```\nThe sequence of previous questions is separated by `||` from the linearized schema. In the absence of previous questions (for example, for the first question in a dialogue or for Spider questions), this separator is omitted.\n\nThe model outputs the database identifier and the SQL query that will be executed on the database to answer the user's current question in the dialog.\n\n```\n[db_id] | [sql]\n```\n\n\n### Performance\n\nOut of the box, this model achieves 52.5 % question match accuracy on the CoSQL development set.\n\nUsing the PICARD constrained decoding method (see [the official PICARD implementation](https://github.com/ElementAI/picard)), the model's performance can be improved to **54.2 %** question match accuracy on the CoSQL development set.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nPlease see [the official repository](https://github.com/ElementAI/picard) for scripts and docker images that support evaluation and serving of this model.\n\n\n### References\n\n1.
