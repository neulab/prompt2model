However , when it comes to France , you have another special choice : treehouses . In France , treehouses are offered to travelers as a new choice in many places . The price may be a little higher , but you do have a chance to _ your childhood memories . Alain Laurens , one of France ' s top treehouse designers , said , ' Most of the people might have the experience of building a den when they were young . And they like that feeling of freedom when they are children . ' Its fairy - tale style gives travelers a special feeling . It seems as if they are living as a forest king and enjoying the fresh air in the morning . Another kind of treehouse is the ' star cube ' . It gives travelers the chance of looking at the stars shining in the sky when they are going to sleep . Each ' star cube ' not only offers all the comfortable things that a hotel provides for travelers , but also gives them a chance to look for stars by using a telescope . The glass roof allows you to look at the stars from your bed . \"\n---\n# voidful/bart-eqg-question-generator\n\n## Model description\n\nThis model is a sequence-to-sequence question generator with only the context as an input, and generates a  question as an output.      \nIt is based on a pretrained `bart-base` model, and trained on [EQG-RACE](https://github.com/jemmryx/EQG-RACE) corpus.      \n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model is trained to generate examinations-style multiple choice question.\n\n#### How to use\n\nThe model takes context as an input sequence, and will generate a question as an output sequence. The max sequence length is 1024 tokens. Inputs should be organised into the following format:\n```\ncontext\n```\nThe input sequence can then be encoded and passed as the `input_ids` argument in the model's `generate()` method.\n", "size_bytes": "712397877", "downloads": 8707}
