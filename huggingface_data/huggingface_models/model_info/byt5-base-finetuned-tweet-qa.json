Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is usable on a downstream task.\nByT5 works especially well on noisy text data,*e.g.*, `google/byt5-base` significantly outperforms [mt5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-base) on [TweetQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06292).\nPaper: [ByT5: Towards a token-free future with pre-trained byte-to-byte models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf)\nAuthors: *Linting Xue, Aditya Barua, Noah Constant, Rami Al-Rfou, Sharan Narang, Mihir Kale, Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel* \n\n\n## Details of the downstream task (Question Answering) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda\n\n[TweetQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweet_qa)\n\n\nWith social media becoming increasingly more popular, lots of news and real-time events are being covered. Developing automated question answering systems is critical to the effectiveness of many applications that rely on real-time knowledge. While previous question answering (QA) datasets have focused on formal text such as news and Wikipedia, we present the first large-scale dataset for QA over social media data. To make sure that the tweets are meaningful and contain interesting information, we gather tweets used by journalists to write news articles. We then ask human annotators to write questions and answers upon these tweets. Unlike other QA datasets like SQuAD (in which the answers are extractive), we allow the answers to be abstractive. The task requires the model to read a short tweet and a question and outputs a text phrase (does not need to be in the tweet) as the answer.\n\n- Data Instances:\n\nSample\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Question\": \"who is the tallest host?\",\n    \"Answer\": [\"sam bee\",\"sam bee\"],\n    \"Tweet\": \"Don't believe @ConanOBrien's height lies.
