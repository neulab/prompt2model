It is based on the pretrained ByT5 model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13626) and finetuned on Icelandic error correction data along with synthetic error data. The model is trained using the HuggingFace and PyTorch libraries.\n\nThe model is trained to correct a single sentence at a time, but may work on longer context.\n\nThe model performs well on correcting a variety of common issues in Icelandic text.\n\nThis README will be updated soon along with citation reference.\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "2326697929", "downloads": 6}
