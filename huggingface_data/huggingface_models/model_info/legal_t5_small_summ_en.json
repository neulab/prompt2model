It was first released in\n[this repository](https://github.com/agemagician/LegalTrans). This model is trained on three parallel corpus from jrc-acquis.\n\n\n## Model description\n\nlegal_t5_small_summ_en is based on the `t5-small` model and was trained on a large corpus of parallel text. This is a smaller model, which scales the baseline model of t5 down by using `dmodel = 512`, `dff = 2,048`, 8-headed attention, and only 6 layers each in the encoder and decoder. This variant has about 60 million parameters.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model could be used for summarization of legal texts written in English.\n\n### How to use\n\nHere is how to use this model to summarize legal text written in English in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead, TranslationPipeline\n\npipeline = TranslationPipeline(\nmodel=AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained(\"SEBIS/legal_t5_small_summ_en\"),\ntokenizer=AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(pretrained_model_name_or_path = \"SEBIS/legal_t5_small_summ_en\", do_lower_case=False, \n                                            skip_special_tokens=True),\n    device=0\n)\n\nen_text = \"THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 15 thereof, Whereas: (1) Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 [2] fixes the amount of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed taking into account the factors set out in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.

It has a total of approximately 220M parameters and was trained using the encoder-decoder architecture. The optimizer used is AdaFactor with inverse square root learning rate schedule for pre-training.\n### Preprocessing\n\nAn unigram model trained with 88M lines of text from the parallel corpus (of all possible language pairs) to get the vocabulary (with byte pair encoding), which is used with this model.\n\n### Pretraining\n\n\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen the model is used for classification test dataset, achieves the following results:\n\nTest results :\n\n| Model | Rouge1  | Rouge2 | Rouge Lsum |\n|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|   legal_t5_small_summ_en | 78.11|68.78 |77.0|\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n> Created by [Ahmed Elnaggar/@Elnaggar_AI](https://twitter.com/Elnaggar_AI) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prof-ahmed-elnaggar/)\n", "size_bytes": "242087370", "downloads": 27}
