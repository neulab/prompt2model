This model is specifically tuned for computer \nscience papers.\n\nThis model is the result of a fine-tuning process done on [sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6).\nWe performed a first fine-tuning epoch on CSPubSumm (Ed Collins, et al. \"A supervised approach to extractive summarisation of scientific papers.\"), \nBIOPubSumm, and AIPubSumm (L. Cagliero, M. La Quatra \"Extracting highlights of scientific articles: A supervised summarization approach.\").\n\nA second fine-tuning epoch was performed only on CSPubSumm to let the model better understand how computer science titles are composed.\n\nYou can find more details in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicolovergaro/DNLP_project).\n\n# Usage\nThis checkpoint should be loaded into `BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained`. See the \n[BART docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart#transformers.BartForConditionalGeneration) for more information.\n\n# Metrics\nWe have tested the model on all three the test sets, with the following results:\n\n|   Dataset  | Rouge-1 F1 | Rouge-2 F1 | Rouge-L F1 | BERTScore F1 |\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|\n|  CSPubSumm |   0.55842  |   0.38177  |   0.50117  |    0.92329   |\n|  AIPubSumm |   0.44824  |   0.25147  |   0.37326  |    0.90774   |\n| BIOPubSumm |   0.45350  |   0.24498  |   0.38614  |    0.90123   |", "size_bytes": "1222361081", "downloads": 3}
