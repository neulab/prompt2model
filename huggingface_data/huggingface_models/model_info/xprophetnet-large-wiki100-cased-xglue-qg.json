The original implementation is Fairseq version at [github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet).   \n\nxProphetNet is also served as the baseline model for xGLUE cross-lingual natural language generation tasks.  \nFor xGLUE corss-lingual NLG tasks, xProphetNet is finetuned with English data, but inference with both English and other zero-shot language data.  \n### Usage\nA quick usage is like: \n```\nfrom transformers import ProphetNetTokenizer, ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration, ProphetNetConfig\n\nmodel = ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('microsoft/xprophetnet-large-wiki100-cased-xglue-qg')\ntokenizer = ProphetNetTokenizer.from_pretrained('microsoft/xprophetnet-large-wiki100-cased-xglue-qg')\n\nEN_SENTENCE = \"Google left China in 2010\"\nZH_SENTENCE = \"Google\u57282010\u5e74\u79bb\u5f00\u4e2d\u56fd\"\ninputs = tokenizer([EN_SENTENCE, ZH_SENTENCE], padding=True, max_length=256, return_tensors='pt')\n\nsummary_ids = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], num_beams=4, max_length=100, early_stopping=True)\nprint([tokenizer.decode(g) for g in summary_ids])  \n```\n### Citation\n```bibtex\n@article{yan2020prophetnet,\n  title={Prophetnet: Predicting future n-gram for sequence-to-sequence pre-training},\n  author={Yan, Yu and Qi, Weizhen and Gong, Yeyun and Liu, Dayiheng and Duan, Nan and Chen, Jiusheng and Zhang, Ruofei and Zhou, Ming},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04063},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "2464535191", "downloads": 5}
