To bring additional errors, random typos were introduced to the input sentences using the [nlpaug](https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug) library. Since the model was trained on only one task, there are no prefixes needed.\n\nThe model was trained as a part of the project during the [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/course/2022/) course. ONNX version of the model is deployed on the [site](https://edge-ai.vercel.app/models/grammar-check) and can be run directly in the browser.", "size_bytes": "124910170", "downloads": 30}
