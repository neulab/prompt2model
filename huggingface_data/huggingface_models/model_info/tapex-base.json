The original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Table-Pretraining).\n\n## Model description\n\nTAPEX (**Ta**ble **P**re-training via **Ex**ecution) is a conceptually simple and empirically powerful pre-training approach to empower existing models with *table reasoning* skills. TAPEX realizes table pre-training by learning a neural SQL executor over a synthetic corpus, which is obtained by automatically synthesizing executable SQL queries.\n\nTAPEX is based on the BART architecture, the transformer encoder-decoder (seq2seq) model with a bidirectional (BERT-like) encoder and an autoregressive (GPT-like) decoder.\n\n## Intended Uses\n\nYou can use the raw model for simulating neural SQL execution, i.e., employ TAPEX to execute a SQL query on a given table. However, the model is mostly meant to be fine-tuned on a supervised dataset. Currently TAPEX can be fine-tuned to tackle table question answering tasks and table fact verification tasks. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=tapex) to look for fine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\n### How to Use\n\nHere is how to use this model in transformers:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import TapexTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration\nimport pandas as pd\n\ntokenizer = TapexTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/tapex-base\")\nmodel = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/tapex-base\")\n\ndata = {\n    \"year\": [1896, 1900, 1904, 2004, 2008, 2012],\n    \"city\": [\"athens\", \"paris\", \"st. louis\", \"athens\", \"beijing\", \"london\"]\n}\ntable = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(data)\n\n# tapex accepts uncased input since it is pre-trained on the uncased corpus\nquery = \"select year where city = beijing\"\nencoding = tokenizer(table=table, query=query, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(**encoding)\n\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(outputs, skip_special_tokens=True))\n# ['2008']\n```\n\n### How to Fine-tuning\n\nPlease find the fine-tuning script [here](https://github.com/SivilTaram/transformers/tree/add_tapex_bis/examples/research_projects/tapex).\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{\n    liu2022tapex,\n    title={{TAPEX}: Table Pre-training via Learning a Neural {SQL} Executor},\n    author={Qian Liu and Bei Chen and Jiaqi Guo and Morteza Ziyadi and Zeqi Lin and Weizhu Chen and Jian-Guang Lou},\n    booktitle={International Conference on Learning Representations},\n    year={2022},\n    url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=O50443AsCP}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "557777415", "downloads": 429}
