It was finetuned on the dataset SummScreen using the data preprocessing pipeline from SLED; to load the validation or test set for use with these model, please use the datasets [urialon/summ_screen_validation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/urialon/summ_screen_validation) and [urialon/summ_screen_test](https://huggingface.co/datasets/urialon/summ_screen_test).\n\nThis is the strongest of the Unlimiformer models for SummScreen. \n\n*The inference demo is disabled because you must add the Unlimiformer files to your repo before this model can handle unlimited length input!* See the [Unlimiformer GitHub](https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer) for setup instructions.", "size_bytes": "557762427", "downloads": 37}
