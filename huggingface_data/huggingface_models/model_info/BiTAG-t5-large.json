Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\"\n  example_title: \"BERT abstract\"\n---\n\n```\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"ArvinZhuang/BiTAG-t5-large\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"ArvinZhuang/BiTAG-t5-large\")\n\ntext = \"abstract: [your abstract]\"  # use 'title:' as the prefix for title_to_abs task.\ninput_ids = tokenizer.encode(text, return_tensors='pt')\n\noutputs = model.generate(\n    input_ids,\n    do_sample=True,\n    max_length=500,\n    top_p=0.9,\n    top_k=20,\n    temperature=1,\n    num_return_sequences=10,\n)\n\nprint(\"Output:\\n\" + 100 * '-')\nfor i, output in enumerate(outputs):\n    print(\"{}: {}\".format(i+1, tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True)))\n\n```\nGitHub: https://github.com/ArvinZhuang/BiTAG", "size_bytes": "2950897543", "downloads": 5}
