{"pretrained_model_name": "mys/mt5-small-turkish-question-paraphrasing", "description": "## Overview\nThis model is a finetuned version of [mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small) for question paraphrasing task in Turkish. As a generator model, its capabilities are currently investigated and there is an ongoing effort to further improve it. You can raise an issue [in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/monatis/tqp) for any comments, suggestions or interesting findings when using this model.\n\n## Usage\nYou can generate 5 paraphrases for the input question with The simple code below.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\nmodel_name = \"mys/mt5-small-turkish-question-paraphrasing\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)\n\ntokens = tokenizer.encode_plus(\"Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 ka\u00e7ta ba\u015fl\u0131yor?\", return_tensors='pt')\nparaphrases = model.generate(tokens['input_ids'], max_length=128, num_return_sequences=5, num_beams=5)\ntokenizer.batch_decode(paraphrases, skip_special_tokens=True)\n```\n\nAnd the output will be something like:\n```shell\n['Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 ne zaman ba\u015fl\u0131yor?',\n 'Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 saat ka\u00e7ta ba\u015fl\u0131yor?',\n 'Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 saat ka\u00e7ta ba\u015flar?',\n 'Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 ne zaman ba\u015flayacak?',\n 'Yar\u0131n toplant\u0131 ne zaman ba\u015flar?']\n```\n\n## Dataset\nI used [TQP dataset V0.1](https://github.com/monatis/tqp) that I've published just recently. This model should be taken as as a baseline model for TQP dataset. A cleaning and further improvements in the dataset and an elaborate hyperparameter tuning may boost the performance.\n\n## Citation\nIf you find the dataset or model useful for your research, [consider citation](https://zenodo.org/record/4719801#.YIbI45AzZPZ).", "size_bytes": "1200775901", "downloads": 4}
