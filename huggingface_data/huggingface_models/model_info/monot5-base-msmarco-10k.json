{"pretrained_model_name": "castorini/monot5-base-msmarco-10k", "description": "This model is a T5-base reranker fine-tuned on the MS MARCO passage dataset for 10k steps (or 1 epoch).\n\nThis model usually has a better zero-shot performance than `monot5-base-msmarco`, i.e., it performs better on datasets different from MS MARCO.\n\nFor more details on how to use it, check the following links:\n- [A simple reranking example](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle#a-simple-reranking-example)\n- [Rerank MS MARCO passages](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/docs/experiments-msmarco-passage-subset.md)\n- [Rerank Robust04 documents](https://github.com/castorini/pygaggle/blob/master/docs/experiments-robust04-monot5-gpu.md)\n\nPaper describing the model: [Document Ranking with a Pretrained Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.63/)", "size_bytes": "891731186", "downloads": 13142}
