This is equivalent to `22'000` steps or about `4.3` Billion tokens.\n\n## Training parameters\n\n|                       |               |\n| :-------------------: | :-----------: |\n|  Training batch size  |     `384`     |\n| Evaluation batch size |     `768`     |\n|     learning rate     |    `1e-2`     |\n|         dtype         | `jnp.float32` |\n\n## Preprocessing and the tokenizer\n\nWe tried to keep the preprocessing to a bare minimum. We only replaced URLs, emails and social media user mentions with fixed tokens.\n\nContrary to other pretrained Arabic LMs, we decided to not strip the Arabic diacritics and to keep them part of the vocabulary.\n\nThe tokenizer was trained on `5%` of the training set, with a vocabulary size of `64'000`.\n\nFor more details about preprocessing, check the [tokenizer code](https://huggingface.co/flax-community/arabic-t5-small/blob/main/t5_tokenizer_model.py)\n\n## Data\n\nThe model was trained on the concatenation of the Arabic Billion Words corpus and the Arabic subsets of the mC4 and Oscar datasets.\n\nA random `0.1%` subset of the data was reserved for evaluation and the rest for training.\n\n## Results\n\n|                     |               |\n| :-----------------: | :-----------: |\n| Evaluation accuracy |   `56.84%`    |\n|   Evaluation Loss   |    `2.423`    |\n|    Training Loss    |    `2.392`    |\n|    Training Time    | `22h 23m 51s` |\n\n## Note for finetuning\n\nThis model was pretrained with dropout turned off, so the default `dropout_rate` in the model config is `0`.\nTo finetune the model dropout should be turned be back on, like this:\n\n```python\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"flax-community/arabic-t5-small\", dropout_rate=0.1)\n```\n\nor,\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"flax-community/arabic-t5-small\", dropout_rate=0.1)\n```\n", "size_bytes": "438896645", "downloads": 20}
