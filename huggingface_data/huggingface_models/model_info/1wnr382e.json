The model solves Spider's zero-shot text-to-SQL translation task, and that means that it can generalize to unseen SQL databases.\n\n\n### Training Objective\n\nThis model was initialized with [T5-Large](https://huggingface.co/t5-large) and fine-tuned with the text-to-text generation objective.\n\nQuestions are always grounded in a database schema, and the model is trained to predict the SQL query that would be used to answer the question. The input to the model is composed of the user's natural language question, the database identifier, and a list of tables and their columns:\n\n```\n[question] | [db_id] | [table] : [column] ( [content] , [content] ) , [column] ( ... ) , [...] | [table] : ... | ...\n```\n\nThe model outputs the database identifier and the SQL query that will be executed on the database to answer the user's question:\n\n```\n[db_id] | [sql]\n```\n\n\n### Performance\n\nOut of the box, this model achieves 65.3 % exact-set match accuracy and 67.2 % execution accuracy on the Spider development set.\n\nUsing the PICARD constrained decoding method (see [the official PICARD implementation](https://github.com/ElementAI/picard)), the model's performance can be improved to **69.1 %** exact-set match accuracy and **72.9 %** execution accuracy on the Spider development set.\n\n\n### Usage\n\nPlease see [the official repository](https://github.com/ElementAI/picard) for scripts and docker images that support evaluation and serving of this model.\n\n\n### References\n\n1.
