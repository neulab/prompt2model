{"pretrained_model_name": "PrimeQA/t5-base-hybrid-question-generator", "description": "---\nlicense: apache-2.0\n---\n\n# Model description\n\nThis is an [t5-base](https://huggingface.co/t5-base) model, finetuned to generate questions given a table and linked passages using [HybridQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hybrid_qa) dataset. It was trained to generate questions from reasoning paths extracted from hybrid input, i.e., a table and the passages linked to the table cells. \n\n# Overview\n\n*Language model*: t5-base \\\n*Language*: English \\\n*Task*: Hybrid Question Generation \\\n*Data*: HybridQA\n\n# Intented use and limitations\nOne can use this model to generate questions given a table and linked passages. Biases associated with pre-training of T5 and HybridQA dataset may be present.\n", "size_bytes": "891660223", "downloads": 132}
