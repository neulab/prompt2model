This assumption may lead to performance degradation during inference, where the model needs to compare several system-generated (candidate) summaries that have deviated from the reference summary. To address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm which assumes a non-deterministic distribution so that different candidate summaries are assigned probability mass according to their quality. \n \n- **Developed by:** Yale LILY Lab\n- **Shared by [Optional]:** Yale LILY Lab\n\n- **Model type:** Text2Text Generation\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** More information needed\n- **License:** More information needed\n- **Parent Model:** BART\n- **Resources for more information:**\n \t- [Github Repo](https://github.com/Yale-LILY/BRIO)\n \t- [Associated Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16804)\n\n\n# Uses\n \n\n## Direct Use\nThis model can be used for the task of Text2Text Generation\n \n## Downstream Use [Optional]\n \nFurther analysis also shows that our model can estimate probabilities of candidate summaries that are more correlated with their level of quality.\n \n\n\n \n## Out-of-Scope Use\n \nThe model should not be used to intentionally create hostile or alienating environments for people. \n \n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n \n \nSignificant research has explored bias and fairness issues with language models (see, e.g., [Sheng et al. (2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.\n\n\n\n## Recommendations\n \n \nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model.

As a result, BRIO-Ctr maximizes the parameter sharing between the two stages, and preserves the power of the Seq2Seq model pre-trained on the same dataset.\n\n\n \n# Environmental Impact\n \nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.
