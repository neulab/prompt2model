The CICEROv2 consists of annotated commonsense inferences including cause and emotional reaction, etc. The dialogues are from multiple datasets.\n| Dataset  | #Dialogues| #Instances|\n| -------- | ----- | --------- |\n| DailyDialog| 1118| 3973|\n| MuTual| 1011  | 3384|\n| Dream| 250  | 994|\n\n### Examples\nSome examples of generated results from the pretrained model (the zero-shot setting).\n\n**Subsequent Event**\n```\nWhat is or could be the subsequent event of the target? <sep> \ntarget: Oh .
