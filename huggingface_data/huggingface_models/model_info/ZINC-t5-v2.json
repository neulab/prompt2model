Compared to ZINC-t5, ZINC-t5-v2 uses a character-level tokenizer, and it was also trained on ZINC.\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis model can be used for the prediction of molecules' properties, reactions, or interactions with proteins by changing the way of finetuning.\nAs an example, We finetuned this model to predict products. The model is [here](https://huggingface.co/sagawa/ZINC-t5-productpredicition), and you can use the demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagawa/predictproduct-t5).\nUsing its encoder, we trained a regression model to predict a reaction yield. You can use this demo [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sagawa/predictyield-t5).\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nWe downloaded [ZINC data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lSPCqh31zxTVEhuiPde7W3rZG8kPgp-z) and canonicalized them using RDKit. Then, we dropped duplicates. The total number of data is 22992522, and they were randomly split into train:validation=10:1.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-03\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10.0\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Step   | Accuracy | Validation Loss |\n|:-------------:|:------:|:--------:|:---------------:|\n| 0.2090        | 100000 | 0.9264   | 0.1860          |\n| 0.1628        | 200000 | 0.9349   | 0.1613          |\n| 0.1632        | 300000 | 0.9395   | 0.1467          |\n| 0.1451        | 400000 | 0.9435   | 0.1345          |\n| 0.1311        | 500000 | 0.9465   | 0.1261          |", "size_bytes": "793874509", "downloads": 6}
