I thank all of authors of the different technologies and dataset(s) for their contributions that have made this possible. \n\nPlease make sure to properly cite the authors of the different technologies and dataset(s) as they absolutely deserve credit for their contributions.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nDataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hadasu92/cnn-articles-after-basic-cleaning\n\n## Training procedure\nCPU trained on all samples where the article length is less than 820 words and the summary length is no more than 52 words in length. Additionally, any sample that was missing a new article or summarization was removed. In all, 24,911 out of the possible 42,025 samples were used for training/testing/evaluation.\n\nHere is the link to the code that was used to train this model:\nhttps://github.com/DunnBC22/NLP_Projects/blob/main/Text%20Summarization/CNN%20News%20Text%20Summarization.ipynb\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 2e-05\n- train_batch_size: 1\n- eval_batch_size: 1\n- seed: 42\n- gradient_accumulation_steps: 16\n- total_train_batch_size: 16\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 100\n- num_epochs: 2\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss |  Rouge1  |  Rouge2  |   RougeL   | RougeLsum  |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n| 0.7491        | 1.0   | 1089 | 0.1618          |    N/A   |    N/A   |     N/A    |    N/A     |\n| 0.1641        | 2.0   | 2178 | 0.1603          | 0.834343 | 0.793822 |  0.823824  |\t0.823778  |\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.21.3\n- Pytorch 1.12.1\n- Datasets 2.4.0\n- Tokenizers 0.12.1", "size_bytes": "557965433", "downloads": 12}
