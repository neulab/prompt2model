It was fine-tuned on the [`samsum`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) corpus from [`facebook/bart-large`](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large) checkpoint.\n\n## Usage (Inference)\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nsummarizer = pipeline(\"summarization\", model=\"linydub/bart-large-samsum\")\n\ninput_text = '''\n    Henry: Hey, is Nate coming over to watch the movie tonight?\n    Kevin: Yea, he said he'll be arriving a bit later at around 7 since he gets off of work at 6.
