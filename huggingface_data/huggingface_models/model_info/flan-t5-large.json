[Model Card Authors](#model-card-authors)\n\n# TL;DR\n\nIf you already know T5, FLAN-T5 is just better at everything. For the same number of parameters, these models have been fine-tuned on more than 1000 additional tasks covering also more languages. \nAs mentioned in the first few lines of the abstract : \n>  Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.\n\n**Disclaimer**: Content from **this** model card has been written by the Hugging Face team, and parts of it were copy pasted from the [T5 model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-large).\n\n# Model Details\n\n## Model Description\n\n\n- **Model type:** Language model\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English, Spanish, Japanese, Persian, Hindi, French, Chinese, Bengali, Gujarati, German, Telugu, Italian, Arabic, Polish, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, Oriya, Panjabi, Portuguese, Urdu, Galician, Hebrew, Korean, Catalan, Thai, Dutch, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Bulgarian, Filipino, Central Khmer, Lao, Turkish, Russian, Croatian, Swedish, Yoruba, Kurdish, Burmese, Malay, Czech, Finnish, Somali, Tagalog, Swahili, Sinhala, Kannada, Zhuang, Igbo, Xhosa, Romanian, Haitian, Estonian, Slovak, Lithuanian, Greek, Nepali, Assamese, Norwegian\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Related Models:** [All FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?search=flan-t5)\n- **Original Checkpoints:** [All Original FLAN-T5 Checkpoints](https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/docs/models.md#flan-t5-checkpoints)\n- **Resources for more information:**\n  - [Research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf)\n  - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/google-research/t5x)\n  - [Hugging Face FLAN-T5 Docs (Similar to T5) ](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5)\n\n# Usage\n\nFind below some example scripts on how to use the model in `transformers`:\n\n## Using the Pytorch model\n\n### Running the model on a CPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\", device_map=\"auto\")\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Running the model on a GPU using different precisions\n\n#### FP16\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install accelerate\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\", device_map=\"auto\", torch_dtype=torch.float16)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n#### INT8\n\n<details>\n<summary> Click to expand </summary>\n\n```python\n# pip install bitsandbytes accelerate\nfrom transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\")\nmodel = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"google/flan-t5-large\", device_map=\"auto\", load_in_8bit=True)\n\ninput_text = \"translate English to German: How old are you?\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids)\nprint(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))\n```\n\n</details>\n\n# Uses\n\n## Direct Use and Downstream Use\n\nThe authors write in [the original paper's model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) that: \n\n> The primary use is research on language models, including: research on zero-shot NLP tasks and in-context few-shot learning NLP tasks, such as reasoning, and question answering; advancing fairness and safety research, and understanding limitations of current large language models\n\nSee the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf) for further details.\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\nMore information needed.\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThe information below in this section are copied from the model's [official model card](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\n## Ethical considerations and risks\n\n> Flan-T5 is fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data that was not filtered for explicit content or assessed for existing biases. As a result the model itself is potentially vulnerable to generating equivalently inappropriate content or replicating inherent biases in the underlying data.\n\n## Known Limitations\n\n> Flan-T5 has not been tested in real world applications.\n\n## Sensitive Use:\n\n> Flan-T5 should not be applied for any unacceptable use cases, e.g., generation of abusive speech.\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\nThe model was trained on a mixture of tasks, that includes the tasks described in the table below (from the original paper, figure 2):\n\n![table.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1666363265279-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\nAccording to the model card from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> These models are based on pretrained T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) and fine-tuned with instructions for better zero-shot and few-shot performance. There is one fine-tuned Flan model per T5 model size.\n\nThe model has been trained on TPU v3 or TPU v4 pods, using [`t5x`](https://github.com/google-research/t5x) codebase together with [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax).\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluated the model on various tasks covering several languages (1836 in total). See the table below for some quantitative evaluation:\n![image.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1668072995230-62441d1d9fdefb55a0b7d12c.png)\nFor full details, please check the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf).\n\n## Results \n\nFor full results for FLAN-T5-Large, see the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf), Table 3.\n\n# Environmental Impact\n\nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.
