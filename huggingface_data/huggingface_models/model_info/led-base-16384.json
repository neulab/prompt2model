Peters, Arman Cohan, *led-base-16384* was initialized from [*bart-base*](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-base) since both models share the exact same architecture. To be able to process 16K tokens, *bart-base*'s position embedding matrix was simply copied 16 times.\n\nThis model is especially interesting for long-range summarization and question answering.\n\n## Fine-tuning for down-stream task\n\n[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12LjJazBl7Gam0XBPy_y0CTOJZeZ34c2v?usp=sharing) shows how *led-base-16384* can effectively be fine-tuned on a downstream task.\n", "size_bytes": "647693783", "downloads": 10407}
