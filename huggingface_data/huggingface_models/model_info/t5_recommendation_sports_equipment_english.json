This allows for relationships to be taken into account.\n- By feeding an LLM a history of items purchased as the input and the next item purchased as the output, the model can learn what to recommend based on the semantics of the product's name.\n  - Taking multiple examples of different users' purchase history into account, the LLM can also learn what genres of products go with what.\n  - This essentially replicates collaboritve filtering\n- Benefits include:\n  - Getting past the cold-start problem with ease (when new items are introduced, the model will be able to understand what's similar to it from the name alone).\n  - Avoiding tedious, manual feature engineering (using natural language, the LLM will automatically learn).\n \nThe github repository for fine-tuning this model can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Mohammadhia/t5_p5_recommendation_system).\n\nThe fine-tuned T5 model achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 0.4554\n- Rouge1: 57.1429\n- Rouge2: 47.6190\n- Rougel: 55.5556\n- Rougelsum: 55.5556\n- Gen Len: 3.9048\n\n## Model description\n\nT5 is an open-source sequence-to-sequence model released by Google in 2020, from which several variants have been developed. This fine-tuned version is an attempt to replicate what was presented in the [P5 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13366.pdf), with a custom dataset (based on sports equipment).\n\nMore about this model (T5) can be viewed [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5).\n\nThe P5 models from the paper can be viewed on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/makitanikaze/P5) as well as in this [repository](https://github.com/jeykigung/P5).\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nCan be used as you please, but is limited to the sports equipment dataset it was fine-tuned on. Your mileage may vary.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nPlease see this [repository](https://github.com/Mohammadhia/t5_p5_recommendation_system) for training and evaluation data.\n\n## Training procedure\n\nPlease see this [repository](https://github.com/Mohammadhia/t5_p5_recommendation_system) for training and evaluation data.\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 0.0001\n- train_batch_size: 4\n- eval_batch_size: 4\n- seed: 42\n- gradient_accumulation_steps: 4\n- total_train_batch_size: 16\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | Rouge1  | Rouge2  | Rougel  | Rougelsum | Gen Len |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|\n| No log        | 0.96  | 6    | 6.7375          | 8.7066  | 0.9524  | 8.7598  | 8.6011    | 19.0    |\n| No log        | 1.96  | 12   | 2.8089          | 23.8095 | 9.5238  | 23.3333 | 23.3333   | 3.1429  |\n| No log        | 2.96  | 18   | 0.9394          | 9.5238  | 4.7619  | 9.5238  | 9.5238    | 3.1905  |\n| No log        | 3.96  | 24   | 0.6679          | 33.3333 | 14.2857 | 32.8571 | 32.5397   | 3.5714  |\n| No log        | 4.96  | 30   | 0.6736          | 26.5079 | 9.5238  | 25.0794 | 25.0794   | 4.2381  |\n| No log        | 5.96  | 36   | 0.6658          | 38.7302 | 23.8095 | 37.3016 | 37.4603   | 4.0476  |\n| No log        | 6.96  | 42   | 0.6460          | 46.3492 | 33.3333 | 45.6349 | 45.2381   | 3.8571  |\n| No log        | 7.96  | 48   | 0.5596          | 52.3810 | 42.8571 | 50.7937 | 50.7937   | 4.0     |\n| No log        | 8.96  | 54   | 0.5082          | 57.1429 | 47.6190 | 55.5556 | 55.5556   | 3.9524  |\n| No log        | 9.96  | 60   | 0.4554          | 57.1429 | 47.6190 | 55.5556 | 55.5556   | 3.9048  |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.26.0\n- Pytorch 1.13.1+cu116\n- Datasets 2.8.0\n- Tokenizers 0.13.2\n", "size_bytes": "2950848513", "downloads": 55}
