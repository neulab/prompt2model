A sparsity of language resources has hampered previous work on Indonesian. The Transformer is a new architecture rapidly becoming dominant for NLP, surpassing alternatives like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) is a Transformer model that converts all text-based language problems to text-to-text format for English. The multilingual variant is mT5 (multilingual T5) which has shown promising results on many NLP tasks across languages. However, the size of this multilingual model is a drawback for its application in real production applications, which sometimes require only one language. In this study, the mT5 model was adapted for only one language, Indonesian, resulting in a pre-trained T5 model that was specific only for Indonesian with a smaller size. For performance comparison, we fine-tuned this model and the mT5 model to the Sentiment Analysis (SA), Question Generation (QG), and Question Answering (QA) tasks with the exact mechanism and dataset. Fine-tuned model based on our model achieved 77.18% accuracy on SA, 8% higher than the mT5-based model, and obtained nearly the same score as the mT5-based model on QG and QA. The results confirm that it is possible to produce a smaller pre-trained model that maintains comparable yields while reducing the model size by up to 58%. In addition, the resulting model requires less memory, loads faster, and inference times faster.", "size_bytes": "977328205", "downloads": 153}
