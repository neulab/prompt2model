The language features a very small volcabulary (~130 words) and a very simple grammar structure. \n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis model aims to translate English to Toki pona.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThe training data is acquired from all En-Toki sentence pairs on [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en) (~20000 pairs), without any filtering. Since this dataset mostly only includes core words (pu), it may produce inaccurate results when encountering more complex words. The model achieved a BLEU score of 54 on the testing set.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 2e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 16\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10\n- mixed_precision_training: Native AMP\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.20.1\n- Pytorch 1.11.0\n- Datasets 2.3.2\n- Tokenizers 0.12.1\n", "size_bytes": "310020485", "downloads": 19}
