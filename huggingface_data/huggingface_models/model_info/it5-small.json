All the training was conducted on a single TPU3v8-VM machine on Google Cloud. Refer to the Tensorboard tab of the repository for an overview of the training process.\n\n*The inference widget is deactivated because the model needs a task-specific seq2seq fine-tuning on a downstream task to be useful in practice. The models in the  [`it5`](https://huggingface.co/it5) organization provide some examples of this model fine-tuned on various downstream task.*\n\n## Model variants\n\nThis repository contains the checkpoints for the `base` version of the model. The model was trained for one epoch (1.05M steps) on the [Thoroughly Cleaned Italian mC4 Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gsarti/clean_mc4_it) (~41B words, ~275GB) using \ud83e\udd17 Datasets and the `google/t5-v1_1-small` improved configuration. The training procedure is made available [on Github](https://github.com/gsarti/t5-flax-gcp).\n\nThe following table summarizes the parameters for all available models\n\n|                       |`it5-small` (this one) |`it5-base`            |`it5-large`            |`it5-base-oscar`                  |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n|`dataset`              |`gsarti/clean_mc4_it`  |`gsarti/clean_mc4_it` |`gsarti/clean_mc4_it`  |`oscar/unshuffled_deduplicated_it`|\n|`architecture`         |`google/t5-v1_1-small` |`google/t5-v1_1-base` |`google/t5-v1_1-large` |`t5-base`                         |\n|`learning rate`        | 5e-3                  | 5e-3                 | 5e-3                  | 1e-2                             |\n|`steps`                | 1'050'000             | 1'050'000            | 2'100'000             | 258'000                          |\n|`training time`        | 36 hours              | 101 hours            | 370 hours             | 98 hours                         |\n|`ff projection`        |`gated-gelu`           |`gated-gelu`          |`gated-gelu`           |`relu`                            |\n|`tie embeds`           |`false`                |`false`               |`false`                |`true`                            |\n|`optimizer`            | adafactor             | adafactor            | adafactor             | adafactor                        |\n|`max seq. length`      | 512                   | 512                  | 512                   | 512                              |\n|`per-device batch size`| 16                    | 16                   | 8                     | 16                               |\n|`tot. batch size`      | 128                   | 128                  | 64                    | 128                              |\n|`weigth decay`         | 1e-3                  | 1e-3                 | 1e-2                  | 1e-3                             |\n|`validation split size`| 15K examples          | 15K examples         | 15K examples          | 15K examples                     |\n\nThe high training time of `it5-base-oscar` was due to [a bug](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/13012) in the training script.\n\nFor a list of individual model parameters, refer to the `config.json` file in the respective repositories.\n\n## Using the models\n\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenzier, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gsarti/it5-small\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"gsarti/it5-small\")\n```\n\n*Note: You will need to fine-tune the model on your downstream seq2seq task to use it. See an example [here](https://huggingface.co/it5/it5-base-question-answering).*\n\nFlax and Tensorflow versions of the model are also available:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import FlaxT5ForConditionalGeneration, TFT5ForConditionalGeneration\n\nmodel_flax = FlaxT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"gsarti/it5-small\")\nmodel_tf = TFT5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"gsarti/it5-small\")\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nDue to the nature of the web-scraped corpus on which IT5 models were trained, it is likely that their usage could reproduce and amplify pre-existing biases in the data, resulting in potentially harmful content such as racial or gender stereotypes and conspiracist views. For this reason, the study of such biases is explicitly encouraged, and model usage should ideally be restricted to research-oriented and non-user-facing endeavors.\n\n## Model curators\n\nFor problems or updates on this model, please contact [gabriele.sarti996@gmail.com](mailto:gabriele.sarti996@gmail.com).\n\n##  Citation Information\n\n```bibtex\n@article{sarti-nissim-2022-it5,\n    title={IT5: Large-scale Text-to-text Pretraining for Italian Language Understanding and Generation},\n    author={Sarti, Gabriele and Nissim, Malvina},\n    journal={ArXiv preprint 2203.03759},\n    url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03759},\n    year={2022},\n\tmonth={mar}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "307824645", "downloads": 79}
