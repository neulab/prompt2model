It builds on the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) architecture and uses window-based denoising as the pre-training task on a large amount of long dialogue data for further training. Here is a base version of DialogLED, the input length is limited to 16,384 in the pre-training phase.\n\n## Finetuning for Downstream Tasks\nPlease refer to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/DialogLM).", "size_bytes": "647697943", "downloads": 650}
