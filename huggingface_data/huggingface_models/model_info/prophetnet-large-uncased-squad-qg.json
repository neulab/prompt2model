The original implementation is Fairseq version at [github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet).   \n\n### Usage\n```\nfrom transformers import ProphetNetTokenizer, ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration, ProphetNetConfig\n\nmodel = ProphetNetForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased-squad-qg')\ntokenizer = ProphetNetTokenizer.from_pretrained('microsoft/prophetnet-large-uncased-squad-qg')\n\nFACT_TO_GENERATE_QUESTION_FROM = \"\"Bill Gates [SEP] Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975.\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer([FACT_TO_GENERATE_QUESTION_FROM], return_tensors='pt')\n\n# Generate Summary\nquestion_ids = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], num_beams=5, early_stopping=True)\ntokenizer.batch_decode(question_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n# should give: 'along with paul allen, who founded microsoft?'\n```\n### Citation\n```bibtex\n@article{yan2020prophetnet,\n  title={Prophetnet: Predicting future n-gram for sequence-to-sequence pre-training},\n  author={Yan, Yu and Qi, Weizhen and Gong, Yeyun and Liu, Dayiheng and Duan, Nan and Chen, Jiusheng and Zhang, Ruofei and Zhou, Ming},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04063},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "1565504151", "downloads": 205}
