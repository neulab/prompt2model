French to contemporary French. It was introduced in [this paper](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03540226/) (see citation below). The main research repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rbawden/ModFr-Norm). If you use this model, please cite our research paper (see [below](#cite)).\n\n## Model description\n\nThe normalisation model is trained on the [FreEM_norm corpus](https://freem-corpora.github.io/corpora/norm/), which is a parallel data of French texts from the 17th century and their manually normalised versions that follow contemporary French spelling. The model is a transformer model with 2 encoder layers, 4 decoder layers, embedding dimensions of size 256, feedforward dimension of 1024. The associated tokeniser is trained with SentencePiece and the BPE strategy with a BPE vocabulary of 1000 tokens.\n\n### Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe model is designed to be used to normalise 17th c. French texts. The best performance can be seen on texts from similar genres as those produced within this century of French.\n\n### How to use\n\nThe model is to be used with the custom pipeline available in this repository (transformers>=4.21.0):\n\n```\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nnormaliser = pipeline(model=\"rbawden/modern_french_normalisation\", batch_size=32, beam_size=5, cache_file=\"./cache.pickle\", trust_remote_code=True)\n                                              \nlist_inputs = [\"Elle ha\u00ef\u017f\u017foit particulierement le Cardinal de Lorraine;\", \"Adieu, i'iray chez vous tanto\u017ft vous rendre grace.\"]\nlist_outputs = normaliser(list_inputs)\nprint(list_outputs)\n>> [{'text': 'Elle ha\u00efssait particuli\u00e8rement le Cardinal de Lorraine; ', 'alignment': [([0, 3], [0, 3]), ([5, 12], [5, 12]), ([14, 29], [14, 29]), ([31, 32], [31, 32]), ([34, 41], [34, 41]), ([43, 44], [43, 44]), ([46, 53], [46, 53]), ([54, 54], [54, 54])]}, {'text': \"Adieu, j'irai chez vous tant\u00f4t vous rendre gr\u00e2ce. \", 'alignment': [([0, 4], [0, 4]), ([5, 5], [5, 5]), ([7, 8], [7, 8]), ([9, 12], [9, 12]), ([14, 17], [14, 17]), ([19, 22], [19, 22]), ([24, 30], [24, 29]), ([32, 35], [31, 34]), ([37, 42], [36, 41]), ([44, 48], [43, 47]), ([49, 49], [48, 48])]}]\n```\n\nTo disable postprocessing (faster but less good normalisation), set the arguments `no_postproc_lex` and `no_post_clean` to True when instantiating the pipeline:\n```\nnormaliser = pipeline(model=\"rbawden/modern_french_normalisation\", no_postproc_lex=True, no_post_clean=True, batch_size=32, beam_size=5, cache_file=\"./cache.pickle\", trust_remote_code=True)\n\n```\n\n### Limitations and bias\n\nThe model has been learnt in a supervised fashion and therefore like any such model is likely to perform well on texts similar to those used for training and less well on other texts. Whilst care was taken to include a range of different domains from different periods in the 17th c. in the training data, there are nevertheless imbalances, notably with some decades (e.g. 1610s) being underrepresented.\n\nThe model reaches a high performance, but could in rare cases result in changes to the text other than those involving spelling conventions (e.g. changing words, deleting or hallucinating words). A post-processing step is introduced in the pipeline file to avoid these problems, which involves a look-up in a contemporary French lexicon ([The Le*fff*](http://almanach.inria.fr/software_and_resources/custom/Alexina-en.html)) and checks to make sure that the normalised words do not stray too far from the original source words.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe model is trained on the parallel FreEM dataset [FreEM_norm corpus](https://freem-corpora.github.io/corpora/norm/), consisting of 17,930 training sentences and 2,443 development sentences (used for model selection).\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nTexts are normalised (in terms of apostrophes, quotes and spaces), before being tokenised with SentencePiece and a vocabulary size of 1000. The inputs are of the form:\n\n```\nSentence in Early Modern French </s>\n```\nwhere `</s>` is the end-of-sentence (eos) token.\n\n### Training\n\nThe model was trained using [Fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq) and ported to HuggingFace using an adapted version of [Stas's scripts for FSMT models](https://huggingface.co/blog/porting-fsmt).\n\n### Evaluation results\n\nComing soon...
