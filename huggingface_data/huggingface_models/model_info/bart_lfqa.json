When you cool it down, it gains heat back from the air, which is why it feels colder than the air surrounding it. It's the same reason why you feel cold when you turn on a fan. The air around you is losing heat, and the water is gaining heat.\"]\n\n```\n\n## Author\n- Vladimir Blagojevic: `dovlex [at] gmail.com`  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vladblagoje) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blagojevicvladimir/)", "size_bytes": "1625557313", "downloads": 6031}
