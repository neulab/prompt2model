It establishes a **baseline** for automatically translating texts from French to Fon.  \n\n\n#### Limitations and bias\nThis model is limited by its training dataset. This may not generalize well for all use cases in different domains.  \n\n## Training data\nSpecifically, this model is a *m2m100_418M* model that was fine-tuned on JW300 Fon corpus and [LAFAND](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lafand-mt). \n\n## Training procedure\nThis model was trained on NVIDIA V100 GPU\n\n## Eval results on Test set (BLEU score)\nFine-tuning m2m100_418M achieves **4.96 BLEU** on [LAFAND test set](https://github.com/masakhane-io/lafand-mt)\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\nBy David Adelani\n```\n\n```\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "1935804116", "downloads": 9}
