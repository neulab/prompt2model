They weren\u2019t only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.\"\n  example_title: \"Harrison Bergeron\"\n- text: \"The ledge, where I placed my candle, had a few mildewed books piled up in one corner; and it was covered with writing scratched on the paint.

In vapid listlessness I leant my head against the window, and continued spelling over Catherine Earnshaw\u2014Heathcliff\u2014Linton, till my eyes closed; but they had not rested five minutes when a glare of white letters started from the dark, as vivid as spectres\u2014the air swarmed with Catherines; and rousing myself to dispel the obtrusive name, I discovered my candle wick reclining on one of the antique volumes, and perfuming the place with an odour of roasted calf-skin.\"\n  example_title: \"Wuthering Heights\"\n  \ninference:\n  parameters:\n    no_repeat_ngram_size: 2\n    max_length: 32\n    early_stopping: True\n---\n\n# literary analysis with t5-base\n\n- t5 sort-of learning to do literary analysis.
