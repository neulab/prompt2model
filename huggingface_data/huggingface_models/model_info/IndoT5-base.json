This model is pre-trained only and needs to be fine-tuned to be used for specific tasks.\n\n## Pretraining Details\n\nTrained for 1M steps following [`google/t5-v1_1-base`](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-base).\n\n## Model Performance\n\nTBD\n\n## Limitations and bias\n\nThis model also has the problem of biased (unethical, harmful, biased) output results due to the bias of the content of the training data, which is associated with the language model using a large-scale corpus. There is potential. Assuming that this problem may occur, please be careful to use it only for applications that do not cause damage.\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to Tensorflow Research Cloud for providing TPU v3-8s.\n", "size_bytes": "990434381", "downloads": 119}
