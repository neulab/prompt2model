Prisoners represent one extreme on the spectrum of delinquency, and are exposed to a particularly high risk of suicide, with suicide rates about 5 to 8 times higher than in the general population.\nFirst, prisoners show behaviour and personality traits associated with suicide, even before imprisonment; these risk factors are imported into the prison environment.\nThe first weeks of imprisonment are particularly important for suicide prevention, since a considerable proportion of suicides in prisons occur during this period.\nOnly isolated studies have examined whether these factors are related to early suicide in prison, and these show a connection between drug addiction and early prison suicide.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses a case-control design to investigate whether suicides in the first weeks of imprisonment differ from late prison suicide events in terms of their risk and resilience factors.\nPrevious prison sentences are negatively associated with early suicides, as this knowledge of the prison environment facilitates the process of re-adaptation.\nOffences that are closely associated with drug use, such as theft, or offences against the narcotics law, are associated with early suicide events.\nEvidence of mental illness or drug withdrawal is associated with early prison suicides. Assignment of a psychiatrist is protective against suicides during the first days of detention.\nRisk factors change with increasing prison time. \"\"\"\n\ninputs = tokenizer(text, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt').input_ids\noutputs = model.generate(inputs)\ngenerated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)\n```", "size_bytes": "666047481", "downloads": 2}
