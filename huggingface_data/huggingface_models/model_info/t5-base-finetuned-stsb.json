It acheives the following results on the validation set\n- Pearson Correlation Coefficient: 0.8937\n\n\n## Model Details\nT5 is an encoder-decoder model pre-trained on a multi-task mixture of unsupervised and supervised tasks and for which each task is converted into a text-to-text format. \n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Tokenization\nSince, T5 is a text-to-text model, the labels of the dataset are converted as follows:\nFor each example, a sentence as been formed as **\"stsb sentence1: \" + stsb_sent1 + \"sentence2: \" + stsb_sent2** and fed to the tokenizer to get the **input_ids** and **attention_mask**.\nUnlike other **GLUE** tasks, STS-B is a regression task where the goal is to predict a similarity score between 1 and 5. I have used the same stratey as descibed in the T5 paper for fine-tuning. In the paper, it is mentioned as \n``` We found that most of these scores were annotated in increments of 0.2, so we simply rounded any score to the nearest increment of 0.2 and converted the result to a literal string representation of the number (e.g. the floating-point value 2.57 would be mapped to the string \u201c2.6\u201d). At test time, if the model outputs a string corresponding to a number between 1 and 5, we convert it to a floating-point value; otherwise, we treat the model\u2019s prediction as incorrect. This effectively recasts the STS-B\nregression problem as a 21-class classification problem. ```\n\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 3e-4\n- train_batch_size: 32\n- eval_batch_size: 32\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: epsilon=1e-08\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n\n### Training results\n\n\n|Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Pearson Correlation Coefficient |\n|:----:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|\n|   1  |    0.8623     | 0.8200           |\n|   2  |    0.7782     | 0.8675        |\n|   3  |     0.7040   | **0.8937** |", "size_bytes": "891699345", "downloads": 2}
