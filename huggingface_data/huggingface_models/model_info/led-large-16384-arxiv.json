term changes of solar activity has been\nconsidered extensively . many investigators\nstudied the short - term periodicities of the\nvarious indices of solar activity . several\nperiodicities were detected , but the\nperiodicities about 155 days and from the interval\nof @xmath3 $ ] days ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) are\nmentioned most often . first of them was\ndiscovered by @xcite in the occurence rate of\ngamma - ray flares detected by the gamma - ray\nspectrometer aboard the _ solar maximum mission (\nsmm ) . this periodicity was confirmed for other\nsolar flares data and for the same time period\n@xcite . it was also found in proton flares during\nsolar cycles 19 and 20 @xcite , but it was not\nfound in the solar flares data during solar cycles\n22 @xcite . _    several autors confirmed above\nresults for the daily sunspot area data . @xcite\nstudied the sunspot data from 18741984 . she found\nthe 155-day periodicity in data records from 31\nyears . this periodicity is always characteristic\nfor one of the solar hemispheres ( the southern\nhemisphere for cycles 1215 and the northern\nhemisphere for cycles 1621 ) . moreover , it is\nonly present during epochs of maximum activity (\nin episodes of 13 years ) .\nsimilarinvestigationswerecarriedoutby + @xcite .\nthey applied the same power spectrum method as\nlean , but the daily sunspot area data ( cycles\n1221 ) were divided into 10 shorter time series .\nthe periodicities were searched for the frequency\ninterval 57115 nhz ( 100200 days ) and for each of\n10 time series . the authors showed that the\nperiodicity between 150160 days is statistically\nsignificant during all cycles from 16 to 21 . the\nconsidered peaks were remained unaltered after\nremoving the 11-year cycle and applying the power\nspectrum analysis . @xcite used the wavelet\ntechnique for the daily sunspot areas between 1874\nand 1993 . they determined the epochs of\nappearance of this periodicity and concluded that\nit presents around the maximum activity period in\ncycles 16 to 21 . moreover , the power of this\nperiodicity started growing at cycle 19 ,\ndecreased in cycles 20 and 21 and disappered after\ncycle 21 . similaranalyseswerepresentedby + @xcite\n, but for sunspot number , solar wind plasma ,\ninterplanetary magnetic field and geomagnetic\nactivity index @xmath5 . during 1964 - 2000 the\nsunspot number wavelet power of periods less than\none year shows a cyclic evolution with the phase\nof the solar cycle.the 154-day period is prominent\nand its strenth is stronger around the 1982 - 1984\ninterval in almost all solar wind parameters . the\nexistence of the 156-day periodicity in sunspot\ndata were confirmed by @xcite . they considered\nthe possible relation between the 475-day (\n1.3-year ) and 156-day periodicities . the 475-day\n( 1.3-year ) periodicity was also detected in\nvariations of the interplanetary magnetic field ,\ngeomagnetic activity helioseismic data and in the\nsolar wind speed @xcite . @xcite concluded that\nthe region of larger wavelet power shifts from\n475-day ( 1.3-year ) period to 620-day ( 1.7-year\n) period and then back to 475-day ( 1.3-year ) .\nthe periodicities from the interval @xmath6 $ ]\ndays ( @xmath4 $ ] years ) have been considered\nfrom 1968 . @xcite mentioned a 16.3-month (\n490-day ) periodicity in the sunspot numbers and\nin the geomagnetic data . @xcite analysed the\noccurrence rate of major flares during solar\ncycles 19 . they found a 18-month ( 540-day )\nperiodicity in flare rate of the norhern\nhemisphere . @xcite confirmed this result for the\n@xmath7 flare data for solar cycles 20 and 21 and\nfound a peak in the power spectra near 510540 days\n. @xcite found a 17-month ( 510-day ) periodicity\nof sunspot groups and their areas from 1969 to\n1986 . these authors concluded that the length of\nthis period is variable and the reason of this\nperiodicity is still not understood . @xcite and +\n@xcite obtained statistically significant peaks of\npower at around 158 days for daily sunspot data\nfrom 1923 - 1933 ( cycle 16 ) . in this paper the\nproblem of the existence of this periodicity for\nsunspot data from cycle 16 is considered . the\ndaily sunspot areas , the mean sunspot areas per\ncarrington rotation , the monthly sunspot numbers\nand their fluctuations , which are obtained after\nremoving the 11-year cycle are analysed . in\nsection 2 the properties of the power spectrum\nmethods are described . in section 3 a new\napproach to the problem of aliases in the power\nspectrum analysis is presented . in section 4\nnumerical results of the new method of the\ndiagnosis of an echo - effect for sunspot area\ndata are discussed . in section 5 the problem of\nthe existence of the periodicity of about 155 days\nduring the maximum activity period for sunspot\ndata from the whole solar disk and from each solar\nhemisphere separately is considered . to find\nperiodicities in a given time series the power\nspectrum analysis is applied . in this paper two\nmethods are used : the fast fourier transformation\nalgorithm with the hamming window function ( fft )\nand the blackman - tukey ( bt ) power spectrum\nmethod @xcite . the bt method is used for the\ndiagnosis of the reasons of the existence of peaks\n, which are obtained by the fft method . the bt\nmethod consists in the smoothing of a cosine\ntransform of an autocorrelation function using a\n3-point weighting average . such an estimator is\nconsistent and unbiased . moreover , the peaks are\nuncorrelated and their sum is a variance of a\nconsidered time series . the main disadvantage of\nthis method is a weak resolution of the\nperiodogram points , particularly for low\nfrequences . for example , if the autocorrelation\nfunction is evaluated for @xmath8 , then the\ndistribution points in the time domain are :\n@xmath9 thus , it is obvious that this method\nshould not be used for detecting low frequency\nperiodicities with a fairly good resolution .\nhowever , because of an application of the\nautocorrelation function , the bt method can be\nused to verify a reality of peaks which are\ncomputed using a method giving the better\nresolution ( for example the fft method ) . it is\nvaluable to remember that the power spectrum\nmethods should be applied very carefully . the\ndifficulties in the interpretation of significant\npeaks could be caused by at least four effects : a\nsampling of a continuos function , an echo -\neffect , a contribution of long - term\nperiodicities and a random noise . first effect\nexists because periodicities , which are shorter\nthan the sampling interval , may mix with longer\nperiodicities . in result , this effect can be\nreduced by an decrease of the sampling interval\nbetween observations . the echo - effect occurs\nwhen there is a latent harmonic of frequency\n@xmath10 in the time series , giving a spectral\npeak at @xmath10 , and also periodic terms of\nfrequency @xmath11 etc . this may be detected by\nthe autocorrelation function for time series with\na large variance . time series often contain long\n- term periodicities , that influence short - term\npeaks . they could rise periodogram s peaks at\nlower frequencies . however , it is also easy to\nnotice the influence of the long - term\nperiodicities on short - term peaks in the graphs\nof the autocorrelation functions . this effect is\nobserved for the time series of solar activity\nindexes which are limited by the 11-year cycle .\nto find statistically significant periodicities it\nis reasonable to use the autocorrelation function\nand the power spectrum method with a high\nresolution . in the case of a stationary time\nseries they give similar results . moreover , for\na stationary time series with the mean zero the\nfourier transform is equivalent to the cosine\ntransform of an autocorrelation function @xcite .\nthus , after a comparison of a periodogram with an\nappropriate autocorrelation function one can\ndetect peaks which are in the graph of the first\nfunction and do not exist in the graph of the\nsecond function . the reasons of their existence\ncould be explained by the long - term\nperiodicities and the echo - effect . below method\nenables one to detect these effects . ( solid line\n) and the 95% confidence level basing on thered\nnoise ( dotted line ) . the periodogram values are\npresented on the left axis . the lower curve\nillustrates the autocorrelation function of the\nsame time series ( solid line ) . the dotted lines\nrepresent two standard errors of the\nautocorrelation function . the dashed horizontal\nline shows the zero level . the autocorrelation\nvalues are shown in the right axis . ]     because\nthe statistical tests indicate that the time\nseries is a white noise the confidence level is\nnot marked . ]    . ] the method of the diagnosis\nof an echo - effect in the power spectrum ( de )\nconsists in an analysis of a periodogram of a\ngiven time series computed using the bt method .\nthe bt method bases on the cosine transform of the\nautocorrelation function which creates peaks which\nare in the periodogram , but not in the\nautocorrelation function . the de method is used\nfor peaks which are computed by the fft method (\nwith high resolution ) and are statistically\nsignificant . the time series of sunspot activity\nindexes with the spacing interval one rotation or\none month contain a markov - type persistence ,\nwhich means a tendency for the successive values\nof the time series to remember their antecendent\nvalues . thus , i use a confidence level basing on\nthe red noise of markov @xcite for the choice of\nthe significant peaks of the periodogram computed\nby the fft method . when a time series does not\ncontain the markov - type persistence i apply the\nfisher test and the kolmogorov - smirnov test at\nthe significance level @xmath12 @xcite to verify a\nstatistically significance of periodograms peaks .\nthe fisher test checks the null hypothesis that\nthe time series is white noise agains the\nalternative hypothesis that the time series\ncontains an added deterministic periodic component\nof unspecified frequency . because the fisher test\ntends to be severe in rejecting peaks as\ninsignificant the kolmogorov - smirnov test is\nalso used . the de method analyses raw estimators\nof the power spectrum . they are given as follows\n@xmath13    for @xmath14 + where @xmath15 for\n@xmath16 + @xmath17 is the length of the time\nseries @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the mean value .\nthe first term of the estimator @xmath20 is\nconstant . the second term takes two values (\ndepending on odd or even @xmath21 ) which are not\nsignificant because @xmath22 for large m. thus ,\nthe third term of ( 1 ) should be analysed .\nlooking for intervals of @xmath23 for which\n@xmath24 has the same sign and different signs one\ncan find such parts of the function @xmath25 which\ncreate the value @xmath20 . let the set of values\nof the independent variable of the autocorrelation\nfunction be called @xmath26 and it can be divided\ninto the sums of disjoint sets : @xmath27 where +\n@xmath28 + @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 + @xmath32 +\n@xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37\n@xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40    well , the set\n@xmath41 contains all integer values of @xmath23\nfrom the interval of @xmath42 for which the\nautocorrelation function and the cosinus function\nwith the period @xmath43 $ ] are positive . the\nindex @xmath44 indicates successive parts of the\ncosinus function for which the cosinuses of\nsuccessive values of @xmath23 have the same sign .\nhowever , sometimes the set @xmath41 can be empty\n. for example , for @xmath45 and @xmath46 the set\n@xmath47 should contain all @xmath48 $ ] for which\n@xmath49 and @xmath50 , but for such values of\n@xmath23 the values of @xmath51 are negative .\nthus , the set @xmath47 is empty .    . the\nperiodogram values are presented on the left axis\n. the lower curve illustrates the autocorrelation\nfunction of the same time series . the\nautocorrelation values are shown in the right axis\n. ] let us take into consideration all sets\n\\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } which\nare not empty . because numberings and power of\nthese sets depend on the form of the\nautocorrelation function of the given time series\n, it is impossible to establish them arbitrary .\nthus , the sets of appropriate indexes of the sets\n\\{@xmath52 } , \\{@xmath53 } and \\{@xmath41 } are\ncalled @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56\nrespectively . for example the set @xmath56\ncontains all @xmath44 from the set @xmath57 for\nwhich the sets @xmath41 are not empty . to\nseparate quantitatively in the estimator @xmath20\nthe positive contributions which are originated by\nthe cases described by the formula ( 5 ) from the\ncases which are described by the formula ( 3 ) the\nfollowing indexes are introduced : @xmath58\n@xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63\n@xmath64 taking for the empty sets \\{@xmath53 }\nand \\{@xmath41 } the indices @xmath65 and @xmath66\nequal zero . the index @xmath65 describes a\npercentage of the contribution of the case when\n@xmath25 and @xmath51 are positive to the positive\npart of the third term of the sum ( 1 ) . the\nindex @xmath66 describes a similar contribution ,\nbut for the case when the both @xmath25 and\n@xmath51 are simultaneously negative . thanks to\nthese one can decide which the positive or the\nnegative values of the autocorrelation function\nhave a larger contribution to the positive values\nof the estimator @xmath20 . when the difference\n@xmath67 is positive , the statement the\n@xmath21-th peak really exists can not be rejected\n. thus , the following formula should be satisfied\n: @xmath68    because the @xmath21-th peak could\nexist as a result of the echo - effect , it is\nnecessary to verify the second condition :\n@xmath69\\in c_m.\\ ] ]    . the periodogram values\nare presented on the left axis . the lower curve\nillustrates the autocorrelation function of the\nsame time series ( solid line ) . the dotted lines\nrepresent two standard errors of the\nautocorrelation function . the dashed horizontal\nline shows the zero level . the autocorrelation\nvalues are shown in the right axis . ]    to\nverify the implication ( 8) firstly it is\nnecessary to evaluate the sets @xmath41 for\n@xmath70 of the values of @xmath23 for which the\nautocorrelation function and the cosine function\nwith the period @xmath71 $ ] are positive and the\nsets @xmath72 of values of @xmath23 for which the\nautocorrelation function and the cosine function\nwith the period @xmath43 $ ] are negative .\nsecondly , a percentage of the contribution of the\nsum of products of positive values of @xmath25 and\n@xmath51 to the sum of positive products of the\nvalues of @xmath25 and @xmath51 should be\nevaluated . as a result the indexes @xmath65 for\neach set @xmath41 where @xmath44 is the index from\nthe set @xmath56 are obtained . thirdly , from all\nsets @xmath41 such that @xmath70 the set @xmath73\nfor which the index @xmath65 is the greatest\nshould be chosen .    the implication ( 8) is true\nwhen the set @xmath73 includes the considered\nperiod @xmath43 $ ] . this means that the greatest\ncontribution of positive values of the\nautocorrelation function and positive cosines with\nthe period @xmath43 $ ] to the periodogram value\n@xmath20 is caused by the sum of positive products\nof @xmath74 for each @xmath75-\\frac{m}{2k},[\\frac{\n2m}{k}]+\\frac{m}{2k})$ ] .    when the implication\n( 8) is false , the peak @xmath20 is mainly\ncreated by the sum of positive products of\n@xmath74 for each @xmath76-\\frac{m}{2k},\\big [\n\\frac{2m}{n}\\big ] + \\frac{m}{2k } \\big ) $ ] ,\nwhere @xmath77 is a multiple or a divisor of\n@xmath21 . it is necessary to add , that the de\nmethod should be applied to the periodograms peaks\n, which probably exist because of the echo -\neffect . it enables one to find such parts of the\nautocorrelation function , which have the\nsignificant contribution to the considered peak .\nthe fact , that the conditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are\nsatisfied , can unambiguously decide about the\nexistence of the considered periodicity in the\ngiven time series , but if at least one of them is\nnot satisfied , one can doubt about the existence\nof the considered periodicity . thus , in such\ncases the sentence the peak can not be treated as\ntrue should be used .    using the de method it is\nnecessary to remember about the power of the set\n@xmath78 . if @xmath79 is too large , errors of an\nautocorrelation function estimation appear . they\nare caused by the finite length of the given time\nseries and as a result additional peaks of the\nperiodogram occur . if @xmath79 is too small ,\nthere are less peaks because of a low resolution\nof the periodogram . in applications @xmath80 is\nused . in order to evaluate the value @xmath79 the\nfft method is used . the periodograms computed by\nthe bt and the fft method are compared . the\nconformity of them enables one to obtain the value\n@xmath79 .    . the fft periodogram values are\npresented on the left axis . the lower curve\nillustrates the bt periodogram of the same time\nseries ( solid line and large black circles ) .\nthe bt periodogram values are shown in the right\naxis . ] in this paper the sunspot activity data (\naugust 1923 - october 1933 ) provided by the\ngreenwich photoheliographic results ( gpr ) are\nanalysed . firstly , i consider the monthly\nsunspot number data . to eliminate the 11-year\ntrend from these data , the consecutively smoothed\nmonthly sunspot number @xmath81 is subtracted from\nthe monthly sunspot number @xmath82 where the\nconsecutive mean @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 the\nvalues @xmath83 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 are\ncalculated using additional data from last six\nmonths of cycle 15 and first six months of cycle\n17 .    because of the north - south asymmetry of\nvarious solar indices @xcite , the sunspot\nactivity is considered for each solar hemisphere\nseparately . analogously to the monthly sunspot\nnumbers , the time series of sunspot areas in the\nnorthern and southern hemispheres with the spacing\ninterval @xmath87 rotation are denoted . in order\nto find periodicities , the following time series\nare used : + @xmath88   + @xmath89    + @xmath90\n+ in the lower part of figure [ f1 ] the\nautocorrelation function of the time series for\nthe northern hemisphere @xmath88 is shown . it is\neasy to notice that the prominent peak falls at 17\nrotations interval ( 459 days ) and @xmath25 for\n@xmath91 $ ] rotations ( [ 81 , 162 ] days ) are\nsignificantly negative . the periodogram of the\ntime series @xmath88 ( see the upper curve in\nfigures [ f1 ] ) does not show the significant\npeaks at @xmath92 rotations ( 135 , 162 days ) ,\nbut there is the significant peak at @xmath93 (\n243 days ) . the peaks at @xmath94 are close to\nthe peaks of the autocorrelation function . thus ,\nthe result obtained for the periodicity at about\n@xmath0 days are contradict to the results\nobtained for the time series of daily sunspot\nareas @xcite .    for the southern hemisphere (\nthe lower curve in figure [ f2 ] ) @xmath25 for\n@xmath95 $ ] rotations ( [ 54 , 189 ] days ) is\nnot positive except @xmath96 ( 135 days ) for\nwhich @xmath97 is not statistically significant .\nthe upper curve in figures [ f2 ] presents the\nperiodogram of the time series @xmath89 . this\ntime series does not contain a markov - type\npersistence . moreover , the kolmogorov - smirnov\ntest and the fisher test do not reject a null\nhypothesis that the time series is a white noise\nonly . this means that the time series do not\ncontain an added deterministic periodic component\nof unspecified frequency . the autocorrelation\nfunction of the time series @xmath90 ( the lower\ncurve in figure [ f3 ] ) has only one\nstatistically significant peak for @xmath98 months\n( 480 days ) and negative values for @xmath99 $ ]\nmonths ( [ 90 , 390 ] days ) . however , the\nperiodogram of this time series ( the upper curve\nin figure [ f3 ] ) has two significant peaks the\nfirst at 15.2 and the second at 5.3 months ( 456 ,\n159 days ) . thus , the periodogram contains the\nsignificant peak , although the autocorrelation\nfunction has the negative value at @xmath100\nmonths .    to explain these problems two\nfollowing time series of daily sunspot areas are\nconsidered : + @xmath101   + @xmath102     + where\n@xmath103    the values @xmath104 for @xmath105\nand @xmath106 are calculated using additional\ndaily data from the solar cycles 15 and 17 .\nand the cosine function for @xmath45 ( the period\nat about 154 days ) . the horizontal line ( dotted\nline ) shows the zero level . the vertical dotted\nlines evaluate the intervals where the sets\n@xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) are searched . the\npercentage values show the index @xmath65 for each\n@xmath41 for the time series @xmath102 ( in\nparentheses for the time series @xmath101 ) . in\nthe right bottom corner the values of @xmath65 for\nthe time series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are\nwritten . ] ( the 500-day period ) ]    the\ncomparison of the functions @xmath25 of the time\nseries @xmath101 ( the lower curve in figure [ f4\n] ) and @xmath102 ( the lower curve in figure [ f5\n] ) suggests that the positive values of the\nfunction @xmath110 of the time series @xmath101 in\nthe interval of @xmath111 $ ] days could be caused\nby the 11-year cycle . this effect is not visible\nin the case of periodograms of the both time\nseries computed using the fft method ( see the\nupper curves in figures [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) or the\nbt method ( see the lower curve in figure [ f6 ] )\n. moreover , the periodogram of the time series\n@xmath102 has the significant values at @xmath112\ndays , but the autocorrelation function is\nnegative at these points . @xcite showed that the\nlomb - scargle periodograms for the both time\nseries ( see @xcite , figures 7 a - c ) have a\npeak at 158.8 days which stands over the fap level\nby a significant amount . using the de method the\nabove discrepancies are obvious . to establish the\n@xmath79 value the periodograms computed by the\nfft and the bt methods are shown in figure [ f6 ]\n( the upper and the lower curve respectively ) .\nfor @xmath46 and for periods less than 166 days\nthere is a good comformity of the both\nperiodograms ( but for periods greater than 166\ndays the points of the bt periodogram are not\nlinked because the bt periodogram has much worse\nresolution than the fft periodogram ( no one know\nhow to do it ) ) . for @xmath46 and @xmath113 the\nvalue of @xmath21 is 13 ( @xmath71=153 $ ] ) . the\ninequality ( 7 ) is satisfied because @xmath114 .\nthis means that the value of @xmath115 is mainly\ncreated by positive values of the autocorrelation\nfunction . the implication ( 8) needs an\nevaluation of the greatest value of the index\n@xmath65 where @xmath70 , but the solar data\ncontain the most prominent period for @xmath116\ndays because of the solar rotation . thus ,\nalthough @xmath117 for each @xmath118 , all sets\n@xmath41 ( see ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) without the set\n@xmath119 ( see ( 4 ) ) , which contains @xmath120\n$ ] , are considered . this situation is presented\nin figure [ f7 ] . in this figure two curves\n@xmath121 and @xmath122 are plotted . the vertical\ndotted lines evaluate the intervals where the sets\n@xmath107 ( for @xmath123 ) are searched . for\nsuch @xmath41 two numbers are written : in\nparentheses the value of @xmath65 for the time\nseries @xmath101 and above it the value of\n@xmath65 for the time series @xmath102 . to make\nthis figure clear the curves are plotted for the\nset @xmath124 only . ( in the right bottom corner\ninformation about the values of @xmath65 for the\ntime series @xmath102 , for @xmath109 are written\n. ) the implication ( 8) is not true , because\n@xmath125 for @xmath126 . therefore ,\n@xmath43=153\\notin c_6=[423,500]$ ] . moreover ,\nthe autocorrelation function for @xmath127 $ ] is\nnegative and the set @xmath128 is empty . thus ,\n@xmath129 . on the basis of these information one\ncan state , that the periodogram peak at @xmath130\ndays of the time series @xmath102 exists because\nof positive @xmath25 , but for @xmath23 from the\nintervals which do not contain this period .\nlooking at the values of @xmath65 of the time\nseries @xmath101 , one can notice that they\ndecrease when @xmath23 increases until @xmath131 .\nthis indicates , that when @xmath23 increases ,\nthe contribution of the 11-year cycle to the peaks\nof the periodogram decreases . an increase of the\nvalue of @xmath65 is for @xmath132 for the both\ntime series , although the contribution of the\n11-year cycle for the time series @xmath101 is\ninsignificant . thus , this part of the\nautocorrelation function ( @xmath133 for the time\nseries @xmath102 ) influences the @xmath21-th peak\nof the periodogram . this suggests that the\nperiodicity at about 155 days is a harmonic of the\nperiodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days\n. ( solid line ) and consecutively smoothed\nsunspot areas of the one rotation time interval\n@xmath134 ( dotted line ) . both indexes are\npresented on the left axis . the lower curve\nillustrates fluctuations of the sunspot areas\n@xmath135 . the dotted and dashed horizontal lines\nrepresent levels zero and @xmath136 respectively .\nthe fluctuations are shown on the right axis . ]\nthe described reasoning can be carried out for\nother values of the periodogram . for example ,\nthe condition ( 8) is not satisfied for @xmath137\n( 250 , 222 , 200 days ) . moreover , the\nautocorrelation function at these points is\nnegative . these suggest that there are not a true\nperiodicity in the interval of [ 200 , 250 ] days\n. it is difficult to decide about the existence of\nthe periodicities for @xmath138 ( 333 days ) and\n@xmath139 ( 286 days ) on the basis of above\nanalysis . the implication ( 8) is not satisfied\nfor @xmath139 and the condition ( 7 ) is not\nsatisfied for @xmath138 , although the function\n@xmath25 of the time series @xmath102 is\nsignificantly positive for @xmath140 . the\nconditions ( 7 ) and ( 8) are satisfied for\n@xmath141 ( figure [ f8 ] ) and @xmath142 .\ntherefore , it is possible to exist the\nperiodicity from the interval of @xmath1 $ ] days\n. similar results were also obtained by @xcite for\ndaily sunspot numbers and daily sunspot areas .\nshe considered the means of three periodograms of\nthese indexes for data from @xmath143 years and\nfound statistically significant peaks from the\ninterval of @xmath1 $ ] ( see @xcite , figure 2 )\n. @xcite studied sunspot areas from 1876 - 1999\nand sunspot numbers from 1749 - 2001 with the help\nof the wavelet transform . they pointed out that\nthe 154 - 158-day period could be the third\nharmonic of the 1.3-year ( 475-day ) period .\nmoreover , the both periods fluctuate considerably\nwith time , being stronger during stronger sunspot\ncycles . therefore , the wavelet analysis suggests\na common origin of the both periodicities . this\nconclusion confirms the de method result which\nindicates that the periodogram peak at @xmath144\ndays is an alias of the periodicity from the\ninterval of @xmath1 $ ] in order to verify the\nexistence of the periodicity at about 155 days i\nconsider the following time series : + @xmath145\n+ @xmath146    + @xmath147   + the value @xmath134\nis calculated analogously to @xmath83 ( see sect .\nthe values @xmath148 and @xmath149 are evaluated\nfrom the formula ( 9 ) . in the upper part of\nfigure [ f9 ] the time series of sunspot areas\n@xmath150 of the one rotation time interval from\nthe whole solar disk and the time series of\nconsecutively smoothed sunspot areas @xmath151 are\nshowed . in the lower part of figure [ f9 ] the\ntime series of sunspot area fluctuations @xmath145\nis presented . on the basis of these data the\nmaximum activity period of cycle 16 is evaluated .\nit is an interval between two strongest\nfluctuations e.a . @xmath152 $ ] rotations . the\nlength of the time interval @xmath153 is 54\nrotations . if the about @xmath0-day ( 6 solar\nrotations ) periodicity existed in this time\ninterval and it was characteristic for strong\nfluctuations from this time interval , 10 local\nmaxima in the set of @xmath154 would be seen .\nthen it should be necessary to find such a value\nof p for which @xmath155 for @xmath156 and the\nnumber of the local maxima of these values is 10 .\nas it can be seen in the lower part of figure [ f9\n] this is for the case of @xmath157 ( in this\nfigure the dashed horizontal line is the level of\n@xmath158 ) . figure [ f10 ] presents nine time\ndistances among the successive fluctuation local\nmaxima and the horizontal line represents the\n6-rotation periodicity . it is immediately\napparent that the dispersion of these points is 10\nand it is difficult to find even few points which\noscillate around the value of 6 . such an analysis\nwas carried out for smaller and larger @xmath136\nand the results were similar . therefore , the\nfact , that the about @xmath0-day periodicity\nexists in the time series of sunspot area\nfluctuations during the maximum activity period is\nquestionable .    . the horizontal line represents\nthe 6-rotation ( 162-day ) period . ]    ]    ]\nto verify again the existence of the about\n@xmath0-day periodicity during the maximum\nactivity period in each solar hemisphere\nseparately , the time series @xmath88 and @xmath89\nwere also cut down to the maximum activity period\n( january 1925december 1930 ) . the comparison of\nthe autocorrelation functions of these time series\nwith the appriopriate autocorrelation functions of\nthe time series @xmath88 and @xmath89 , which are\ncomputed for the whole 11-year cycle ( the lower\ncurves of figures [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) , indicates\nthat there are not significant differences between\nthem especially for @xmath23=5 and 6 rotations (\n135 and 162 days ) ) . this conclusion is\nconfirmed by the analysis of the time series\n@xmath146 for the maximum activity period . the\nautocorrelation function ( the lower curve of\nfigure [ f11 ] ) is negative for the interval of [\n57 , 173 ] days , but the resolution of the\nperiodogram is too low to find the significant\npeak at @xmath159 days . the autocorrelation\nfunction gives the same result as for daily\nsunspot area fluctuations from the whole solar\ndisk ( @xmath160 ) ( see also the lower curve of\nfigures [ f5 ] ) . in the case of the time series\n@xmath89 @xmath161 is zero for the fluctuations\nfrom the whole solar cycle and it is almost zero (\n@xmath162 ) for the fluctuations from the maximum\nactivity period . the value @xmath163 is negative\n. similarly to the case of the northern hemisphere\nthe autocorrelation function and the periodogram\nof southern hemisphere daily sunspot area\nfluctuations from the maximum activity period\n@xmath147 are computed ( see figure [ f12 ] ) .\nthe autocorrelation function has the statistically\nsignificant positive peak in the interval of [ 155\n, 165 ] days , but the periodogram has too low\nresolution to decide about the possible\nperiodicities . the correlative analysis indicates\nthat there are positive fluctuations with time\ndistances about @xmath0 days in the maximum\nactivity period . the results of the analyses of\nthe time series of sunspot area fluctuations from\nthe maximum activity period are contradict with\nthe conclusions of @xcite . she uses the power\nspectrum analysis only . the periodogram of daily\nsunspot fluctuations contains peaks , which could\nbe harmonics or subharmonics of the true\nperiodicities . they could be treated as real\nperiodicities . this effect is not visible for\nsunspot data of the one rotation time interval ,\nbut averaging could lose true periodicities . this\nis observed for data from the southern hemisphere\n. there is the about @xmath0-day peak in the\nautocorrelation function of daily fluctuations ,\nbut the correlation for data of the one rotation\ninterval is almost zero or negative at the points\n@xmath164 and 6 rotations . thus , it is\nreasonable to research both time series together\nusing the correlative and the power spectrum\nanalyses . the following results are obtained :\n1 . a new method of the detection of statistically\nsignificant peaks of the periodograms enables one\nto identify aliases in the periodogram . 2 .   two\neffects cause the existence of the peak of the\nperiodogram of the time series of sunspot area\nfluctuations at about @xmath0 days : the first is\ncaused by the 27-day periodicity , which probably\ncreates the 162-day periodicity ( it is a\nsubharmonic frequency of the 27-day periodicity )\nand the second is caused by statistically\nsignificant positive values of the autocorrelation\nfunction from the intervals of @xmath165 $ ] and\n@xmath166 $ ] days . the existence of the\nperiodicity of about @xmath0 days of the time\nseries of sunspot area fluctuations and sunspot\narea fluctuations from the northern hemisphere\nduring the maximum activity period is questionable\n. the autocorrelation analysis of the time series\nof sunspot area fluctuations from the southern\nhemisphere indicates that the periodicity of about\n155 days exists during the maximum activity period\n. i appreciate valuable comments from professor j.\njakimiec .\"\"\"\n\nfrom transformers import LEDForConditionalGeneration, LEDTokenizer\nimport
