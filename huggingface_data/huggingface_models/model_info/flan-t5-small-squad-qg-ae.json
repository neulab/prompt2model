is fine-tuned version of [google/flan-t5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small) for question generation and answer extraction jointly on the [lmqg/qg_squad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmqg/qg_squad) (dataset_name: default) via [`lmqg`](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation).\n\n\n### Overview\n- **Language model:** [google/flan-t5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-small)   \n- **Language:** en  \n- **Training data:** [lmqg/qg_squad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmqg/qg_squad) (default)\n- **Online Demo:** [https://autoqg.net/](https://autoqg.net/)\n- **Repository:** [https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation](https://github.com/asahi417/lm-question-generation)\n- **Paper:**

extraction\nanswer = pipe(\"generate question: <hl> Beyonce <hl> further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records.\")\n\n# question generation\nquestion = pipe(\"extract answers: <hl> Beyonce further expanded her acting career, starring as blues singer Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic, Cadillac Records. <hl> Her performance
