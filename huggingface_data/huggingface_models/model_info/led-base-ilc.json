Peters, Arman Cohan, *led-base-16384* was initialized from [*bart-base*](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-base) since both models share the exact same architecture. To be able to process 16K tokens, *bart-base*'s position embedding matrix was simply copied 16 times.\n\n```Python\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"CPU\"\n\ncheckpoint = \"d0r1h/led-base-ilc\"\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, return_dict_in_generate=True).to(device)\ncase = \".......\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(case, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(device)\nglobal_attention_mask = torch.zeros_like(input_ids)\nglobal_attention_mask[:, 0] = 1\nsequences = model.generate(input_ids, \n                           global_attention_mask=global_attention_mask).sequences\nsummary = tokenizer.batch_decode(sequences, \n                                 skip_special_tokens=True)\n                                 \n```\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen the model is used for summarizing ILC documents(10 samples), it achieves the following results:\n\n| Model |            rouge1-f  |  rouge1-p  |  rouge2-f   |  rouge2-p  | rougeL-f   |  rougeL-p  |\n|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|\n| led-ilc      | **42** |  **47** | **22**  | **24** | **39**  | **44** | \n| led-base          | 3     |  39     | 1      | 21     | 3      | 37 |\n\n[This notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/d0r1h/Notebooks/blob/main/NLP/Summarization/led_base_ilc_summarization.ipynb) shows how *led* can effectively be used for downstream tasks such as summarization.\n", "size_bytes": "647678513", "downloads": 8}
