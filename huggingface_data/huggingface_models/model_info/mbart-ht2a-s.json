The dataset includes around 1M Czech news-based documents consisting of a Headline, Abstract, and Full-text sections. Truncation and padding were configured for 512 tokens for the encoder and 128 for the decoder.\n\n## Training\nThe model has been trained on 1x NVIDIA Tesla A100 40GB for 20 hours, 1x NVIDIA Tesla V100 32GB for 40 hours, and 4x NVIDIA Tesla A100 40GB for 20 hours. During training, the model has seen 6928K documents corresponding to roughly 8 epochs.\n\n# Use\nAssuming you are using the provided Summarizer.ipynb file.\n```python\ndef summ_config():\n    cfg = OrderedDict([\n        # summarization model - checkpoint from website\n        (\"model_name\", \"krotima1/mbart-ht2a-s\"),\n        (\"inference_cfg\", OrderedDict([\n            (\"num_beams\", 4),\n            (\"top_k\", 40),\n            (\"top_p\", 0.92),\n            (\"do_sample\", True),\n            (\"temperature\", 0.89),\n            (\"repetition_penalty\", 1.2),\n            (\"no_repeat_ngram_size\", None),\n            (\"early_stopping\", True),\n            (\"max_length\", 128),\n            (\"min_length\", 10),\n        ])),\n        #texts to summarize\n        (\"text\",\n            [\n                \"Input your Czech text\",\n            ]\n        ),\n    ])\n    return cfg\ncfg = summ_config()\n#load model    \nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(cfg[\"model_name\"])\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(cfg[\"model_name\"])\n# init summarizer\nsummarize = Summarizer(model, tokenizer, cfg[\"inference_cfg\"])\nsummarize(cfg[\"text\"])\n```", "size_bytes": "2444592057", "downloads": 6}
