The instruction dataset involved is [Self-instruct-starcoder](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/self-instruct-starcoder)\nwhich was built by boostrapping on StarCoder's generations.\n## Uses\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\nThe model was fine-tuned with the following template\n```\nQuestion: <instruction>\n\nAnswer: <output>\n```\nIf you have your model and tokenizer loaded, you can use the following code to make the model generate the right output to a given instruction\n\n```python\ninstruction = \"Write a function to compute the GCD between two integers a and b\"\nprompt = f\"Question:{instruction}\\n\\nAnswer:\"\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\")[\"input_ids\"]\ncompletion = model.generate(input_ids, max_length=200)\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(completion[:,input_ids.shape[1]:])[0])\n```\n\n## More information\n\nFor additional information, check\n- [self-intruct-starcoder](https://huggingface.co/codeparrot/self-instruct-starcoder)\n- [starcoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder)", "size_bytes": 63277785088, "downloads": 129}
