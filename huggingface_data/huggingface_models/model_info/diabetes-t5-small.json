(2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.330.pdf) and [Bender et al. (2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445922)). Predictions generated by the model may include disturbing and harmful stereotypes across protected classes; identity characteristics; and sensitive, social, and occupational groups.\n \n \n## Recommendations\n \nUsers (both direct and downstream) should be made aware of the risks, biases and limitations of the model. More information needed for further recommendations.\n \n \n# Training Details\n \n## Training Data\n \nThe model is pre-trained on the [Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4)](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4), which was developed and released in the context of the same [research paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) as T5.\n \nThe model was pre-trained on a on a **multi-task mixture of unsupervised (1.) and supervised tasks (2.)**.\nSee the [T5-small model card](https://huggingface.co/t5-small?text=My+name+is+Wolfgang+and+I+live+in+Berlin) for further training data details.\n \n## Training Procedure\n \n \n### Preprocessing\n \nMore information needed\n \n### Speeds, Sizes, Times\n \nMore information needed\n \n# Evaluation\n \n \n## Testing Data, Factors & Metrics\n \n### Testing Data\n \nMore information needed\n \n### Factors\n \n \n### Metrics\n \nMore information needed\n## Results \n \nMore information needed\n \n# Model Examination\n \nMore information needed\n \n# Environmental Impact\n \n \nCarbon emissions can be estimated using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al.
