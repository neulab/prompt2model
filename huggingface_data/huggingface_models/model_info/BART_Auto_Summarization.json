This model utilizes the 'facebook/bart-base' pre-trained model.\"\n\n# Language\nlanguage = \"English\"\n\n# Intended Use\nintended_use = \"The BART Text Summarization model is intended to generate abstractive summaries for given input texts. It can be used in applications where summarizing lengthy texts into concise summaries is required.\"\n\n# Limitations\nlimitations = \"The BART model's performance may vary depending on the complexity and length of the input text. It may not accurately summarize texts with highly technical or domain-specific content. Additionally, the model was trained on a rather small dataset which may result in dissatisfied predictions.\"\n\n# Evaluation Metrics\nevaluation_metrics = \"The BART Text Summarization model can be evaluated using various metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), and METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering). These metrics measure the quality and similarity of the generated summaries to human-written references.\"\n\n# Version\nversion = \"1.0\"\n\n\n# Deployment Instructions\nuser_text = input(\"Enter the text you want to summarize: \")\ntokenized_user_text = tokenizer.batch_encode_plus([user_text], truncation=True, padding='longest', max_length=max_input_length, return_tensors='pt')\nuser_input_ids = tokenized_user_text['input_ids'].to(device)\nuser_attention_mask = tokenized_user_text['attention_mask'].to(device)\noutputs = model.generate(input_ids=user_input_ids, attention_mask=user_attention_mask, max_length=max_target_length)\ndecoded_summaries = [tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True) for output in outputs]\nfor summary in decoded_summaries:\n    print(\"Generated Summary:\")\n    print(summary)\n\n", "size_bytes": "557969145", "downloads": 4}
