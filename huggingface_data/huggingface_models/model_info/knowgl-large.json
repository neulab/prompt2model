Given a sentence, KnowGL generates triple(s) in the following format:\n```\n[(subject mention # subject label # subject type) | relation label | (object mention # object label # object type)]\n```\nIf there are more than one triples generated, they are separated by `$` in the output. More details in [Rossiello et al. (AAAI 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13952.pdf).\n\nThe model achieves state-of-the-art results for relation extraction on the REBEL dataset. See results in [Mihindukulasooriya et al. (ISWC 2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05188.pdf).\n\nThe generated labels (for the subject, relation, and object) and their types can be directly mapped to Wikidata IDs associated with them.\n\n#### Citation\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{knowgl-aaai_2023_demo,\n  author    = {Gaetano Rossiello and\n               Md.
