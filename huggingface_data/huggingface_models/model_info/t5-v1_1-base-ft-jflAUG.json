Training smaller and/or comparably sized models is a WIP.\n\n# t5-v1_1-base-ft-jflAUG\n\n**GOAL:** a more robust and generalized grammar and spelling correction model that corrects everything in a single shot. It should have a minimal impact on the semantics of correct sentences (i.e. it does not change things that do not need to be changed).\n\n- this model _(at least from preliminary testing)_ can handle large amounts of errors in the source text (i.e. from audio transcription) and still produce cohesive results. \n- a fine-tuned version of [google/t5-v1_1-base](https://huggingface.co/google/t5-v1_1-base) on an expanded version of the [JFLEG dataset](https://aclanthology.org/E17-2037/).\n\n## Model description\n\n- this is a WIP. This fine-tuned model is v1.\n- long term: a generalized grammar and spelling correction model that can handle lots of things at the same time.\n- currently, it seems to be more of a \"gibberish to mostly correct English\" translator\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\n- try some tests with the [examples here](https://www.engvid.com/english-resource/50-common-grammar-mistakes-in-english/)\n- thus far, some limitations are: sentence fragments are not autocorrected (at least, if entered individually), some more complicated pronoun/they/he/her etc. agreement is not always fixed.\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\n- trained as text-to-text\n- JFLEG dataset + additional selected and/or generated grammar corrections\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 6e-05\n- train_batch_size: 8\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- distributed_type: multi-GPU\n- gradient_accumulation_steps: 8\n- total_train_batch_size: 64\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: cosine\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_ratio: 0.05\n- num_epochs: 5\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.17.0\n- Pytorch 1.10.0+cu111\n- Datasets 2.0.0\n- Tokenizers 0.11.6\n", "size_bytes": "990347691", "downloads": 9}
