On A100, however, it does.\n\nThat is why we suggest to use [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) for training.\nIn particular, we recommend the [ZeRO-3 Example](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/deepspeed#zero3-example) `auto` configuration.\n\n> ZeRO-Offload pushes the boundary of the maximum model size that can be trained efficiently using minimal GPU resources, by exploiting computational and memory resources on both GPUs and their host CPUs.\n\nsee [ZeRO-Offload](https://www.deepspeed.ai/features/#zero-offload) \n\n## License - The MIT License\nCopyright 2022 Stefan Schweter<br>\nCopyright 2022 Philip May, T-Systems onsite<br>\nCopyright 2022 Philipp Schmid\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
