PEGASUS was originally proposed by Jingqing Zhang, Yao Zhao, Mohammad Saleh and Peter J. Liu in [PEGASUS: Pre-training with Extracted Gap-sentences for Abstractive Summarization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08777.pdf). \n\n### How to use \nWe provide a simple snippet of how to use this model for the task of financial summarization in PyTorch.\n\n```Python\nfrom transformers import PegasusTokenizer, PegasusForConditionalGeneration, TFPegasusForConditionalGeneration\n\n# Let's load the model and the tokenizer \nmodel_name = \"human-centered-summarization/financial-summarization-pegasus\"\ntokenizer = PegasusTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nmodel = PegasusForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name) # If you want to use the Tensorflow model \n                                                                    # just replace with TFPegasusForConditionalGeneration\n\n\n# Some text to summarize here\ntext_to_summarize = \"National Commercial Bank (NCB), Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest lender by assets, agreed to buy rival Samba Financial Group for $15 billion in the biggest banking takeover this year.NCB will pay 28.45 riyals ($7.58) for each Samba share, according to a statement on Sunday, valuing it at about 55.7 billion riyals. NCB will offer 0.739 new shares for each Samba share, at the lower end of the 0.736-0.787 ratio the banks set when they signed an initial framework agreement in June.The offer is a 3.5% premium to Samba\u2019s Oct. 8 closing price of 27.50 riyals and about 24% higher than the level the shares traded at before the talks were made public. Bloomberg News first reported the merger discussions.The new bank will have total assets of more than $220 billion, creating the Gulf region\u2019s third-largest lender. The entity\u2019s $46 billion market capitalization nearly matches that of Qatar National Bank QPSC, which is still the Middle East\u2019s biggest lender with about $268 billion of assets.\"\n\n# Tokenize our text\n# If you want to run the code in Tensorflow, please remember to return the particular tensors as simply as using return_tensors = 'tf'\ninput_ids = tokenizer(text_to_summarize, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\n# Generate the output (Here, we use beam search but you can also use any other strategy you like)\noutput = model.generate(\n    input_ids, \n    max_length=32, \n    num_beams=5, \n    early_stopping=True\n)\n\n# Finally, we can print the generated summary\nprint(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))\n# Generated Output: Saudi bank to pay a 3.5% premium to Samba share price. Gulf region\u2019s third-largest lender will have total assets of $220 billion\n```\n\n## Evaluation Results\nThe results before and after the fine-tuning on our dataset are shown below:\n\n\n| Fine-tuning |  R-1  |  R-2  |  R-L   |  R-S  |\n|:-----------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|\n| Yes         | 23.55 |  6.99 | 18.14  | 21.36 | \n| No          | 13.8  |  2.4  | 10.63  | 12.03 |\n\n\n## Citation\n\nYou can find more details about this work in the following workshop paper.
