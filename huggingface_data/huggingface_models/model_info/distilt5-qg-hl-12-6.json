The answer spans are highlighted within the text with special highlight tokens.\n\nThe model is distilled using the **No Teacher Distillation** method proposed by Huggingface, [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/seq2seq#distilbart).\n\nWe just copy alternating layers from `t5-base-qg-hl` and finetune more on the same data. Following table lists other distilled models and their metrics.\n\n| Name                                                                            | BLEU-4  | METEOR  | ROUGE-L | QA-EM  | QA-F1  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n| [distilt5-qg-hl-6-4](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilt5-qg-hl-6-4)        | 18.4141 | 24.8417 | 40.3435 | -      | -      |\n| [distilt5-qa-qg-hl-6-4](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilt5-qa-qg-hl-6-4)  | 18.6493 | 24.9685 | 40.5605 | 76.13  | 84.659 |\n| [distilt5-qg-hl-12-6](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilt5-qg-hl-12-6)      | 20.5275 | 26.5010 | 43.2676 | -      | -      |\n| [distilt5-qa-qg-hl-12-6](https://huggingface.co/valhalla/distilt5-qa-qg-hl-12-6)| 20.6109 | 26.4533 | 43.0895 | 81.61  | 89.831 |\n\nYou can play with the model using the inference API, just highlight the answer spans with `<hl>` tokens. For example\n\n`<hl> 42 <hl> is the answer to life, the universe and everything.`\n\nFor more deatils see [this](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation) repo.\n\n### Model in action \ud83d\ude80\n\nYou'll need to clone the [repo](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation).\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patil-suraj/question_generation/blob/master/question_generation.ipynb)\n\n```python3\nfrom pipelines import pipeline\nnlp = pipeline(\"question-generation\", model=\"valhalla/distilt5-qg-hl-12-6\")\nnlp(\"42 is the answer to life, universe and everything.\")\n=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?'}]\n```", "size_bytes": "665069525", "downloads": 6}
