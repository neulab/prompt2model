For QA the input is processed like this `question: question_text context: context_text </s>` \n\nYou can play with the model using the inference API. Here's how you can use it\n\nFor QG\n\n`generate question: <hl> 42 <hl> is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`\n\nFor QA\n\n`question: What is 42 context: 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`\n\nFor more deatils see [this](https://github.com/sabhi27/question_generation) repo.\n\n\n### Model in action \ud83d\ude80\n\nYou'll need to clone the [repo](https://github.com/sabhi27/question_generation).\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sabhi27/question_generation/blob/master/question_generation.ipynb)\n\n```python3\nfrom pipelines import pipeline\nnlp = pipeline(\"multitask-qa-qg\", model=\"sabhi/t5-base-qa-qg\")\n\n# to generate questions simply pass the text\nnlp(\"42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything.\")\n=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?'}]\n\n# for qa pass a dict with \"question\" and \"context\"\nnlp({\n    \"question\": \"What is 42 ?\",\n    \"context\": \"42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything.\"\n})\n=> 'the answer to life, the universe and everything'\n```", "size_bytes": "891612585", "downloads": 5}
