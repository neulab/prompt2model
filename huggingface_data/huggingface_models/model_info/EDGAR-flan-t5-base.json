The [flan-t5-base model](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-base) is the backbone of our model. Here is how to use the model in PyTorch:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"him1411/EDGAR-flan-t5-base\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"him1411/EDGAR-flan-t5-base\")\n```\nOr just clone the model repo\n```\ngit lfs install\ngit clone https://huggingface.co/him1411/EDGAR-flan-t5-base\n```\n\nInference Example\n=============\n\nHere, we provide an example for the \"ContextNER\" task. Below is an example of one instance.\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"him1411/EDGAR-flan-t5-base\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"him1411/EDGAR-flan-t5-base\")\n# Input shows how we have appended instruction from our file for HoC dataset with instance.\ninput = \"14.5 years . The definite lived intangible assets related to the contracts and trade names had estimated weighted average useful lives of 5.9 years and 14.5 years, respectively, at acquisition.\"\ntokenized_input= tokenizer(input)\n# Ideal output for this input is 'Definite lived intangible assets weighted average remaining useful life'\noutput = model(tokenized_input)\n```\n\n\nBibTeX Entry and Citation Info\n===============\nIf you are using our model, please cite our paper:\n\n```bibtex\n@article{gupta2021context,\n  title={Context-NER: Contextual Phrase Generation at Scale},\n  author={Gupta, Himanshu and Verma, Shreyas and Kumar, Tarun and Mishra, Swaroop and Agrawal, Tamanna and Badugu, Amogh and Bhatt, Himanshu Sharad},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.08079},\n  year={2021}\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "1566481573", "downloads": 2}
