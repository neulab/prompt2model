The original implementation is Fairseq version at [github repo](https://github.com/microsoft/ProphetNet).   \n\nxProphetNet is also served as the baseline model for xGLUE cross-lingual natural language generation tasks.  \nFor xGLUE corss-lingual NLG tasks, xProphetNet is finetuned with English data, but inference with both English and other zero-shot language data. \n\n### Usage\n\nThis pre-trained model can be fine-tuned on *sequence-to-sequence* tasks. The model could *e.g.* be trained on English headline generation as follows:\n\n```python \nfrom transformers import XLMProphetNetForConditionalGeneration, XLMProphetNetTokenizer\n\nmodel = XLMProphetNetForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/xprophetnet-large-wiki100-cased\")\ntokenizer = XLMProphetNetTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"microsoft/xprophetnet-large-wiki100-cased\")\n\ninput_str = \"the us state department said wednesday it had received no formal word from bolivia that it was expelling the us ambassador there but said the charges made against him are `` baseless .\"\ntarget_str = \"us rejects charges against its ambassador in bolivia\"\n\ninput_ids = tokenizer(input_str, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\nlabels = tokenizer(target_str, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\n\nloss = model(input_ids, labels=labels).loss\n```\n\nNote that since this model is a multi-lingual model it can be fine-tuned on all kinds of other languages.\n\n### Citation\n```bibtex\n@article{yan2020prophetnet,\n  title={Prophetnet: Predicting future n-gram for sequence-to-sequence pre-training},\n  author={Yan, Yu and Qi, Weizhen and Gong, Yeyun and Liu, Dayiheng and Duan, Nan and Chen, Jiusheng and Zhang, Ruofei and Zhou, Ming},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04063},\n  year={2020}\n}\n```\n", "size_bytes": "2464535191", "downloads": 6469}
