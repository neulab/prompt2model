This created a gold standard dataset of ~5000 notes containing acronyms and abbreviations and their targets with long forms to train and evaluate the model.\n\nWe held out 20% of the ~5000 notes to test the model.\n\nMacro metrics:\n(total correctly disambiguated acronyms and abbreviations per note)\naccuracy = 98.9%, recall = 98.7%, precision = 93.8%, f1 = 96.1%\n\nMicro metrics:\n(individual correctly disambiguated acronyms and abbreviations per note)\nStill to be calculated, of note, less frequently occuring acronyms such as 'IS' for incentive spirometry perform less well than commonly occurring acronyms and abbreviations such as pt (patient), or afib (atrial fibrillation).\n\nBenchmarks:\n- Rouge1_precision: 0.994687\n- Rouge1_recall: 0.976285\n- Rouge1_fmeasure: 0.985218\n- Rouge2_precision: 0.991907\n- Rouge2_recall: 0.972631\n- Rouge2_fmeasure: 0.981505\n- RougeL_precision: 0.995465\n- RougeL_recall: 0.976081\n- RougeL_fmeasure: 0.985006\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "2950901185", "downloads": 2}
