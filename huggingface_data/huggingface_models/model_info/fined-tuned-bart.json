This will benefit most human readers by making it more efficient gain understanding from written text.  Applications for this technology include as a study aide, for people in roles where they are required to quickly assess documents such as book publishers reading through manuscripts to assess if they are fit for publishing or script readers etc. \nThe most significant impact this project has is to increase information assimilation in a compressed timeframe, thus saving time.\n", "size_bytes": "1625537293", "downloads": 11}
