It takes a context  as an input and generates a list of questions and answers as an output. It is based on a pre-trained `t5-small` model and uses a prompt enigneering technique to train.\n\n\n#### How to use\n\nThe model takes the context  (with prompt) as an input sequence and will generate question-answer pairs as an output sequence. The max sequence length is 512 tokens. Inputs should be organized into the following format:\n```\ncontext: context text here. generate questions and answers:\n```\nThe input sequence can then be encoded and passed as the `input_ids` argument in the model's `generate()` method.\n\nYou can try out the demo in the [E2E-QA-mining space app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mojians/E2E-QA-mining)\n\n#### Limitations and bias\nThe model is limited to generating questions in the same style as those found in [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/),  The generated questions can potentially be leading or reflect biases that are present in the context. If the context is too short or completely absent, or if the context and answer do not match, the generated question is likely to be incoherent.\n## Training data\nThe model was fine-tuned on a dataset made up of several well-known QA datasets ([SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/)\uff09\n\n\n## Source and Citation\nPlease find our code and cite us in this repo [https://github.com/jian-mo/E2E-QA-Mining](https://github.com/jian-mo/E2E-QA-Mining)", "size_bytes": "242037327", "downloads": 87}
