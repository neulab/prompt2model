It is based on the multilingual T5 model [google/mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small).\n\n## Training\n\nThe training was conducted with the following hyperparameters:\n\n- base model: [google/mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small)\n- source_prefix: `\"summarize: \"`\n- batch size: 3\n- max_source_length: 800\n- max_target_length: 96\n- warmup_ratio: 0.3\n- number of train epochs: 10\n- gradient accumulation steps: 2\n- learning rate: 5e-5\n\n## Datasets and Preprocessing\n\nThe datasets were preprocessed as follows:\n\nThe summary was tokenized with the [google/mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small) tokenizer. Then only the records with no more than 94 summary tokens were selected.\n\nThe MLSUM dataset has a special characteristic. In the text, the summary is often included completely as one or more sentences. These have been removed from the texts. The reason is that we do not want to train a model that ultimately extracts only sentences as a summary.\n\nThis model is trained on the following datasets:\n\n| Name | Language | License\n|------|----------|--------\n| [CNN Daily - Train](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail) | en | The license is unclear.
