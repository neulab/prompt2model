It inherits the same risks and limitations from [Flan-T5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf):\n\n> Language models, including Flan-T5, can potentially be used for language generation in a harmful way, according to Rae et al. (2021). Flan-T5 should not be used directly in any application, without a prior assessment of safety and fairness concerns specific to the application.\n\nVideoBLIP has not been tested in real world applications. It should not be directly deployed in any applications. Researchers should first carefully assess the safety and fairness of the model in relation to the specific context they\u2019re being deployed within.\n\n### How to use\n\nFor code examples, please refer to the [official repository](https://github.com/yukw777/VideoBLIP).", "size_bytes": 16296171520, "downloads": 4548}
