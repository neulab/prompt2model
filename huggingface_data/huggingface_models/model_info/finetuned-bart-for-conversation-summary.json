Do you want to get together or something?\n      \n      Sarah: How about going to see a movie? Cinemax 26 on Carson Boulevard is showing Enchanted.\n      Laurie: That sounds like a good idea. Maybe we should go out to eat beforehand.\n      \n      Sarah: It is fine with me. Where do you want to meet?\n\n      Christie: Let\u2019s meet at Summer Pizza House. I have not gone there for a long time.\n      \n      Laurie: Good idea again. I heard they just came up with a new pizza. It should be good because Summer Pizza House always has the best pizza in town.\n      \n      Sarah: When should we meet?\n      \n      Christie: Well, the movie is shown at 2:00PM, 4:00PM, 6:00PM and 8:00PM.\n      \n      Laurie: Why don\u2019t we go to the 2:00PM show? We can meet at Summer Pizza House at noon. That will give us plenty of time to enjoy our pizza.\n      \n      Sarah: My cousin Karen is in town. Can I bring her along? I hate to leave her home alone.\n      \n      Christie: Karen is in town? Yes, bring her along. Laurie, you remember Karen? We met her at Sara\u2019s high school graduation party two years ago.\n      \n      Laurie: I do not quite remember her. What does she look like?\n      \n      Sarah: She has blond hair, she is kind of slender, and she is about your height.\n      \n      Laurie: She wears eyeglasses, right?\n      \n      Sarah: Yes, and she was playing the piano off and on during the party.\n      \n      Laurie: I remember her now. Yes, do bring her along Sara. She is such a nice person, and funny too.\n      \n      Sarah: She will be happy to meet both of you again.\n      \n      Christie: What is she doing these days?\n      \n      Sarah: She graduated last June, and she will start her teaching career next week when the new school term begins.\n      \n      Laurie: What grade is she going to teach?\n      \n      Sarah: She will teach kindergarten. She loves working with kids, and she always has such a good rapport with them\n      \n      Christie: Kindergarten? She must be a very patient person. I always think kindergarten is the most difficult class to teach. Most of the kids have never been to school, and they have\n      e never been away from mommy for long.\n      \n      Sarah:  I think Karen will do fine. She knows how to handle young children\n      \n      Laurie: I think the first few weeks will be tough. However, once the routine is set, it should not be too difficult to teach kindergarten.\n      \n      Christie: You are right. The kids might even look forward to going to school since they have so many friends to play with.\n      \n      Sarah: There are so many new things for them to do at school too. They do a lot of crafts in kindergarten. I am always amazed by the things kindergarten teachers do. \n      \n      Laurie: Yes, I have seen my niece come home with so many neat stuff.\n      \n      Christie: Maybe we can ask Karen to show us some of the things that we can do for this Halloween.\n      \n      Laurie: Maybe we can stop by the craft store after the movie. What do you think, Sara?\n      \n      Sarah: I will talk to her. I think she will like that. It will help her with school projects when Halloween comes.\n\n      Christie: Michael\u2019s is a good store for crafts. It always carries a variety of things, and you can find almost anything there.\n      \n      Laurie: There is a Michaels store not far away from Cinemax 26. I believe it is just around the corner, on Pioneer Avenue. We can even walk over there.\n      \n      Sarah: So, we plan to meet for pizza at noon, go to the movies at two, and shop at Michael\u2019s afterward. Right?\n\n      Laurie and Christie: Yes.      \nmodel-index:\n  - name: bart-large-cnn-samsum\n    results:\n      - task:\n          type: summarization\n          name: Conversation Summarization\n        dataset:\n          name: >-\n            SAMSum Corpus: A Human-annotated Dialogue Dataset for Abstractive\n            Summarization\n          type: samsum\n        metrics:\n          - type: rogue-1\n            value: 54.8764\n            name: Validation ROGUE-1\n          - type: rogue-2\n            value: 29.6869,\n            name: Validation ROGUE-2\n          - type: rogue-l\n            value: 44.9874\n            name: Validation ROGUE-L\n          - type: loss\n            value: 1.47812\n            name: loss     \n\n\n---", "size_bytes": "1625537293", "downloads": 1269}
