It has been fine-tuned on the AbLit dataset, which consists of abridged versions of books aligned with their original versions at the passage level. Given a text, the model generates an abridgement of the text based on what it has observed in AbLit. See the paper cited below for more details.\n\n## Model Details\n\n### Model Description\n\n<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->\n\n- **Developed by:** Language Weaver (Melissa Roemmele, Kyle Shaffer, Katrina Olsen, Yiyi Wang, and Steve DeNeefe)\n- **Model type:** Seq2SeqLM\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** English\n- **License:** mit\n- **Finetuned from model:** [facebook/bart-base](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-base)\n\n### Model Sources\n\n<!-- Provide the basic links for the model. -->\n\n- **Repository:** [github.com/roemmele/AbLit](https://github.com/roemmele/AbLit)\n- **Paper:** [AbLit: A Resource for Analyzing and Generating Abridged Versions of English Literature](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.06579.pdf)\n\n## Uses\n\nThis model generates abridged versions of texts informed by the AbLit dataset.\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->\n\nThis model comes from research on abridgement as an NLP task, but the dataset the model is trained on (AbLit) is derived from a small set of texts associated with a specific domain and author. In particular, AbLit consists of British English literature from the 18th and 19th centuries, abridged by a single author. Some of the linguistic properties of these original books do not generalize to other domains of English text, and therefore the model might not produce desirable abridgements for other texts.\n\n## How to Get Started with the Model\n\n```\nIn [1]: from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM \n   ...: tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"roemmele/ablit-bart-base\") \n   ...: model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"roemmele/ablit-bart-base\") \n   ...:  \n   ...: passage = \"The letter was not unproductive. It re-established peace and kindness.\" \n   ...: input_ids = tokenizer( \n   ...:   passage, \n   ...:   padding='max_length', \n   ...:   return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids \n   ...: output_ids = model.generate( \n   ...:   input_ids, \n   ...:   max_length=1024, \n   ...:   num_beams=5, \n   ...:   no_repeat_ngram_size=3 \n   ...:   )[0] \n   ...: abridgement = tokenizer.decode( \n   ...:   output_ids, \n   ...:   skip_special_tokens=True)                                                                                                         \n\nIn [2]: print(abridgement)                                                                                                                  \nThe letter re-established peace and kindness.\n```\n\n## Training Details\n\n### Training Data\n\nThe model is trained on [roemmele/AbLit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roemmele/ablit), specifically the train split of the \"chunks-10-sentences\" subset, i.e.:\n\n```\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\ndata = load_dataset(\"roemmele/ablit\", \"chunks-10-sentences\")\n```\n\n### Training Procedure \n\nWe used the training script [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/examples/pytorch/summarization/run_summarization.py). \n\n#### Training Hyperparameters\n\nWe specified maximum length of 1024 for both the source (original passage) and target (abridged passage), and truncated all tokens beyond this limit. We evaluated each model on the AbLit development set after each epoch and concluded training when cross-entropy loss stopped decreasing. We used a batch size of 4. For all other hyperparameters we used the default values set by this script. \n\n#### Speeds, Sizes, Times\n\n<!-- This section provides information about throughput, start/end time, checkpoint size if relevant, etc. -->\nIt took \u22483 hours to train each model on a g4dn.4xlarge AWS instance.\n\n## Evaluation\n\n### Testing Data\n\n<!-- This should link to a Data Card if possible. -->\nWe evaluated on the test split of the \"chunks-10-sentences\" subset of [roemmele/AbLit](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roemmele/ablit)\n\n### Results\n\n<!-- This section describes the evaluation protocols and provides the results. -->\nThe model obtained a ROUGE-L score of 0.78 on the AbLit test set. See the paper for the results of other metrics.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOur analysis shows that in comparison with human-authored abridgements, the model-generated abridgements tend to preserve more of the original text, suggesting it is challenging to learn what text can be removed while maintaining loyalty to the important parts of the original text.  \n\n## Citation\n\n<!-- If there is a paper or blog post introducing the model, the APA and Bibtex information for that should go in this section. -->\n\n**BibTeX:**\n\n@inproceedings{roemmele2023ablit,\n    title={AbLit: A Resource for Analyzing and Generating Abridged Versions of English Literature},\n    author={Roemmele, Melissa and Shaffer, Kyle and Olsen, Katrina and Wang, Yiyi and DeNeefe, Steve},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Main Volume},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    year={2023}\n}\n\n**APA:**\n\nRoemmele, M., Shaffer, K., Olsen, K., Wang, Y., and DeNeefe, S.
