This model is specifically tuned for artificial \nintelligence papers.\n\nThis model is the result of a fine-tuning process done on [sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6).\nWe performed a first fine-tuning epoch on CSPubSumm (Ed Collins, et al. \"A supervised approach to extractive summarisation of scientific papers.\"), \nBIOPubSumm, and AIPubSumm (L. Cagliero, M. La Quatra \"Extracting highlights of scientific articles: A supervised summarization approach.\").\n\nA second fine-tuning epoch was performed only on AIPubSumm to let the model better understand how artifical intelligence titles are composed.\n\nYou can find more details in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nicolovergaro/DNLP_project).\n\n# Usage\nThis checkpoint should be loaded into `BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained`. See the \n[BART docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bart#transformers.BartForConditionalGeneration) for more information.\n\n# Metrics\nWe have tested the model on all three the test sets, with the following results:\n\n|   Dataset  | Rouge-1 F1 | Rouge-2 F1 | Rouge-L F1 | BERTScore F1 |\n|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------------:|\n|  AIPubSumm |   0.43325  |   0.22397  |   0.36069  |    0.90644   |\n| BIOPubSumm |   0.45472  |   0.24739  |   0.39121  |    0.90131   |\n|  CSPubSumm |   0.52281  |   0.33140  |   0.46635  |    0.91861   |", "size_bytes": "1222361081", "downloads": 4}
