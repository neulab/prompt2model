You may see better results if queries are posed in this fashion.\n- The top two replies were aggregated and presented to the model as the output text.\n- Training for longer will be explored, but given that the dataset has 127k examples and the loss flatlines at 0.5 epochs so this model should be fairly viable.", "size_bytes": "990383595", "downloads": 14}
