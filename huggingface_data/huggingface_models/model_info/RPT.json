It is introduced in the paper [Responsibility Perspective Transfer for Italian Femicide News](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00437v1).\n\n# Abstract\nDifferent ways of linguistically expressing the same real-world event can lead to different perceptions of what happened. Previous work has shown that different descriptions of gender-based violence (GBV) influence the reader's perception of who is to blame for the violence, possibly reinforcing stereotypes which see the victim as partly responsible, too. As a contribution to raise awareness on perspective-based writing, and to facilitate access to alternative perspectives, we introduce the novel task of automatically rewriting GBV descriptions as a means to alter the perceived level of responsibility on the perpetrator. We present a quasi-parallel dataset of sentences with low and high perceived responsibility levels for the perpetrator, and experiment with unsupervised (mBART-based), zero-shot and few-shot (GPT3-based) methods for rewriting sentences. We evaluate our models using a questionnaire study and a suite of automatic metrics.\n\n# How to use\n```python\nfrom transformers import MBartForConditionalGeneration, MBart50TokenizerFast\n\nmodel = MBartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(\"laihuiyuan/RPT\")\ntokenizer = MBart50TokenizerFast.from_pretrained(\"laihuiyuan/RPT\", src_lang=\"it_IT\")\n\nsource = \"Provaglio d'Iseo , donna trovata morta in casa : si sospetta il compagno\"\nmeta_info = \"Simona Simonini, Elio Cadei, partner, percosse, Provaglio d'Iseo, c.\" #<victim name, perpetrator name, relationship, weapon, municipality, place>\n\ninputs = meta_info + ' ' +source\ninputs = tokenizer(inputs, return_tensors=\"pt\")\ndecode_start_id =tokenizer.lang_code_to_id['it_IT']\noutput = model.generate(input_ids=inputs['input_ids'], num_beams=5, max_length=80, forced_bos_token_id=decode_start_id)\ntransferred_text = tokenizer.decode(output[0].tolist(), skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)\n```\n\n# Citation Info\n```BibTeX\n@inproceedings{minnemaa-etal-2023-responsibility,\n    title = \"Responsibility Perspective Transfer for Italian Femicide News\",\n    author = \"Minnemaa, Gosse and Lai, Huiyuan and Muscato, Benedetta and Nissim, Malvina\",\n    booktitle = \"Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023\",\n    month = July,\n    year = \"2023\",\n    address = \"Toronto, Canada\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "2444706397", "downloads": 2}
