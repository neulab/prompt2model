We also evaluate it on a general-domain multilingual testset [Flores-101](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores).\n\n## Intended uses and limitations\n\nYou can use this model for machine translation from Catalan to Chinese. \n\n## How to use\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"projecte-aina/m2m100_418M_ft_zh_ca\")\n\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"projecte-aina/m2m100_418M_ft_zh_ca\")\n```\n\n## Training\n\n### Training data\n\nAs a data for fine-tuning we used the [ca_zh_wikipedia](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/ca_zh_wikipedia) dataset extracted from Wikipedia.\n\n### Training procedure\n\n#### Tokenization\n\nThe original [m2m100_418M](https://huggingface.co/facebook/m2m100_418M) model's sentencepiece tokenizer was used. The fine-tuning dataset that contained both simplified and traditional Chinese was reduced to its simplified form.\n\n#### Hyperparameters\n\nThe model was trained for 15 epochs with the default parameters and \\\\(LR = 2\\mathrm{e}{-5}\\\\).\n\n## Evaluation\n\n### Variable and metrics\n\nWe use the BLEU score for evaluation on test sets: [Flores-101](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores).\n\n### Evaluation results\n\nBelow are the evaluation results on the machine translation from Catalan to Chinese compared with the original m2m100 on a testset: [Flores-101](https://github.com/facebookresearch/flores).\n\n|Test set  | Model  | BLEU  |\n| ------------|-------------| -----|\n|Flores-101 | m2m100  |  24.6  | \n| | m2m100_418M_ft_ca_zh  |  **24.9**  | \n\n\n## Additional information\n\n### Licensing Information\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n\n### Funding\nThis work was funded by the [Departament de la Vicepresid\u00e8ncia i de Pol\u00edtiques Digitals i Territori de la Generalitat de Catalunya](https://politiquesdigitals.gencat.cat/ca/inici/index.html#googtrans(ca|en) within the framework of [Projecte AINA](https://politiquesdigitals.gencat.cat/ca/economia/catalonia-ai/aina).\n\n### Citation Information\n```\n@mastersthesis{MasterThesisZixuanLiu,\n  author  = \"Zixuan Liu\",\n  title   = \"Improving Chinese-Catalan Machine Translation with Wikipedia Parallel\",\n  school  = \"Universitat Pompeu Fabra\",\n  year    = 2022,\n  address = \"Barcelona\",\n  url= \"https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/54142\"\n}\n\n@mastersthesis{MasterThesisChenuyeZhou,\n  author  = \"Chenuye Zhou\",\n  title   = \"Building a Catalan-Chinese parallel corpus for use in MT\",\n  school  = \"Universitat Pompeu Fabra\",\n  year    = 2022,\n  address = \"Barcelona\",\n  url = \"https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/54140\"\n}\n```\n\n### Disclaimer\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\n\nThe models published in this repository are intended for a generalist purpose and are available to third parties.
