Liu* in Here the abstract:\n\nTransfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \u201cColossal Clean Crawled Corpus\u201d, we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our dataset, pre-trained models, and code.\n\n![model image](https://i.imgur.com/jVFMMWR.png)\n\n\n## Details of the downstream task (Question Retrieval from its decomposition) - Dataset \ud83d\udcda \n\nBreak is a human annotated dataset of natural language questions and their Question Decomposition Meaning Representations (QDMRs). Break consists of 83,978 examples sampled from 10 question answering datasets over text, images and databases. This repository contains the Break dataset along with information on the exact data format. \n\n| Dataset  | Split | # samples |\n| -------- | ----- | --------- |\n| break_data | train | 17503    |\n| break_data | valid  | 3130    |\n\nCheck out more about this dataset and others in [NLP Viewer](https://huggingface.co/nlp/viewer/)\n\n\n## Model fine-tuning \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\nThe training script is a slightly modified version of [this  awesome one](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patil-suraj/exploring-T5/blob/master/T5_on_TPU.ipynb) by [Suraj Patil](https://twitter.com/psuraj28). The main change is at preprocessing ```inputs``` and ```targets``` we feed to the model. We do it as a *paraphrasing task*.\n\n\n## Model in Action \ud83d\ude80\n\n```python\n# Tip: By now, install transformers from source\n\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-break_data-question-retrieval\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-break_data-question-retrieval\")\n\n\ndef get_nautural_question(decomposition):\n  input_text = 'translate QDMRs to Natural Language %s </s>' % decomposition\n  features = tokenizer([input_text], return_tensors='pt')\n\n  output = model.generate(input_ids=features['input_ids'], \n               attention_mask=features['attention_mask'],\n               max_length=64)\n\n  return tokenizer.decode(output[0])\n\n\n\ndecomposition = \"return the city that was the birthplace of Bernard Berrian ;return the  city that was  the home of Pablo Picasso ;return the  city of both #1 and #2\"\n\n# Ground Truth: What city was the birthplace of Bernard Berrianand the home of Pablo Picasso?\n\nget_nautural_question(decomposition)\n\n# output: 'What city was the birthplace of Bernard Berrian and the home of Pablo Picasso?'\n```\n> Created by [Manuel Romero/@mrm8488](https://twitter.com/mrm8488) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-romero-cs/)\n\n> Made with <span style=\"color: #e25555;\">&hearts;</span> in Spain\n", "size_bytes": "1187795267", "downloads": 27}
