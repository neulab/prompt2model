It achieves the best performance by a wide margin in intrinsic evaluation, and also the best performance in extrinsic evaluation through dependency parsing. In addition to these fine-tuned models, we also release the source files on [GitHub](https://github.com/ufal/multilexnorm2021) and an interactive demo on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rxpI8IlKk-D2crFqi2hdzbTBIezqgsCg?usp=sharing).\n\n\n## How to use\n\nThe model was *not* fine-tuned in a standard sentence-to-sentence setting \u2013 instead, it was tailored to the token-to-token definition of MultiLexNorm data. Please refer to [**the interactive demo on Colab notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rxpI8IlKk-D2crFqi2hdzbTBIezqgsCg?usp=sharing) to learn how to use these models.\n\n\n## How to cite\n\n```bibtex\n@inproceedings{wnut-ufal,\n  title= \"{\u00daFAL} at {MultiLexNorm} 2021: Improving Multilingual Lexical Normalization by Fine-tuning {ByT5}\",\n  author = \"Samuel, David and Straka, Milan\",\n  booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text (W-NUT 2021)\",\n  year = \"2021\",\n  publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n  address = \"Punta Cana, Dominican Republic\"\n}\n```\n\n\n## ByT5 - Small\n\nByT5 is a tokenizer-free version of [Google's T5](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/exploring-transfer-learning-with-t5.html) and generally follows the architecture of [MT5](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small).\n\nByT5 was only pre-trained on [mC4](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4#c4multilingual) excluding any supervised training with an average span-mask of 20 UTF-8 characters. Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is useable on a downstream task.\n\nByT5 works especially well on noisy text data,*e.g.*, `google/byt5-small` significantly outperforms [mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-small) on [TweetQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06292).\n\nPaper: [ByT5: Towards a token-free future with pre-trained byte-to-byte models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13626)\n\nAuthors: *Linting Xue, Aditya Barua, Noah Constant, Rami Al-Rfou, Sharan Narang, Mihir Kale, Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel* \n", "size_bytes": "1198627501", "downloads": 6}
