Here's a [full article](https://www.vennify.ai/fine-tune-grammar-correction/) on how to train a similar model. \n\n\n## Usage \n\n`pip install happytransformer `\n\n```python\nfrom happytransformer import HappyTextToText, TTSettings\n\nhappy_tt = HappyTextToText(\"T5\", \"vennify/t5-base-grammar-correction\")\n\nargs = TTSettings(num_beams=5, min_length=1)\n\n# Add the prefix \"grammar: \" before each input \nresult = happy_tt.generate_text(\"grammar: This sentences has has bads grammar.\", args=args)\n\nprint(result.text) # This sentence has bad grammar.\n\n\n```", "size_bytes": "891730879", "downloads": 92227}
