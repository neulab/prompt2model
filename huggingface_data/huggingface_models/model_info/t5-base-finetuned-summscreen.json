I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now. Skyler you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Junior you're my big man. There are going to be some things. Things that you'll come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart. Goodbye.\\n\\nScene: White Residence\\n(Three weeks earlier)\\n\\nSkyler: Happy Birthday.\\n\\nWalter: Look at that.\\n\\nSkyler: That is veggie bacon. Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol. You won't even taste the difference. What time do you think you'll be home?\\n\\nWalter: Same time.\\n\\nSkyler: I don't want him dicking you around tonight. You get paid till 5, you work till 5, no later.\\n\\nWalter: Hey.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Happy birthday.\\n\\nWalter: Well, thank you.\\n\\nSkyler: You're late again.\\n\\nWalter Jr: There was no hot water again.\\n\\nSkyler: I have an easy fix for that. You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower.\\n\\nWalter Jr: I have an idea. How about buy a new hot water heater? How's that idea? For the millionth and billionth time.\\n\\nSkyler: Did you take your Echinacea?\\n\\nWalter: Yeah. I think it's getting better.\\n\\nWalter Jr: What the hell is this?\\n\\nWalter: It's veggie bacon. We're watching our cholesterol, I guess.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Not me. I want real bacon. Not this fake crap.\\n\\nSkyler: Too bad. Eat it.\\n\\nWalter Jr: This smells like Band-aids.\\n\\nSkyler: Eat it.\\n\\nWalter Jr: So, how's it feel to be old?\\n\\nWalter: How does it feel to be a smart ass?\\n\\nWalter Jr: Good.\\n\\nWalter: Eat your veggie bacon.\\n\\nScene: High School Parking Lot\\n\\nWalter: You all set?\\n\\nWalter Jr: Yeah, I'm fine.\\n\\nWalter: All right, see you at home.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Okay, see you.\\n\\nScene: Walt\u2019s Classroom\\n\\nWalter: Chemistry. It is the study of what? Anyone? Ben.\\n\\nBen: Chemicals.\\n\\nWalter: Chemicals! No! Chemistry is well, technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change. Now just just think about this. Electrons. They change their energy levels. Molecules. Molecules change their bonds. Elements. They combine and change into compounds. Well, that's all of life. Right? I mean, it's just It's the constant. It's the cycle. It's solution, dissolution, just over and over and over. It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It is fascinating, really. Chad, is there something wrong with your table? Okay. Ionic bonds Are you done? Ionic bonds. Chapter 6.\\n\\nScene: Car Wash\\n\\nWalter: And 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20. Here's your receipt, and hand this claiming disc to your car wash professional. Thank you. Come again.\\n\\nBogdan: He's not coming. He said he quits. I'm gonna run the register.\\n\\nWalter: Bogdan, no. We talked about this.\\n\\nBogdan: I'm shorthanded, Walter. What am I to do? Walter? What am I to do?\\n\\nChad: Hey, Mr. White! Make those tires shine, huh?\\n\\nChad\u2019s Girlfriend: Oh, my God. You would not believe who's cleaning Chad's car. Mr. White from Chemistry.\\n\\nScene: White Residence\\n\\nEveryone: Surprise!\\n\\nWalter Jr: Happy Birthday, Dad!\\n\\nSkyler: You're so very late.\\n\\nCarmen: Really, I'm serious, Skyler. I mean, you're flat as a washboard. You look awesome. She's not showing at all, is she?\\n\\nMarie: She's showing a little.\\n\\nSkyler: Carmen, this is my sister Marie.\\n\\nCarmen: Pleased to meet you.\\n\\nMarie: Hi.\\n\\nHank: Glock 22. It's my daily carry, okay? I mean, unless you're talking, what, plus, P-plus loads, you can forget the 9-mil, all right? I\u2019ve seen one of those bounce off a windshield one time.\\n\\nSteve: Yeah, the way you sh**t.\\n\\nHank: If you're gonna bring a g*n, you gotta bring enough g*n. 40 caliber.\\n\\nWalter Jr: This is awesome right here.\\n\\nHank: Nice, isn't it?\\n\\nWalter Jr: Dad, come check this out.\\n\\nWalter: Yeah, I see it.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Come on, take it.\\n\\nHank: Check it out, Walt.\\n\\nWalter: No, no, it's just heavy.\\n\\nHank: That's why they hire men. Jesus, it's not gonna bite you, all right? Looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he? Hey, Walt. Everybody listen up, listen up, listen up! I'm gonna give a toast. A little toast to my brother-in-law. Come here. Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin, but we're not gonna hold that against you. Because your heart's in the right place, man. Your heart's in the right place. We love you, man. We love you. Everybody! To Walt! Nostrovia!\\n\\nEveryone: Nostrovia!\\n\\nHank: Oh shit, turn on Channel 3.\\n\\nHank(on the news): At which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody. I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque District Office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets.\\n\\nReporter(on the news): Were any shots fired?\\n\\nHank(on the news): No, ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.\\n\\nSteve: Damn, the TV does add ten pounds.\\n\\nMarie: Ten pounds?\\n\\nHank: Hey, sit and spin. Both of you.\\n\\nSkyler: Hank.\\n\\nHank: What? Sorry. You didn't see that.\\n\\nSkyler: So charming.\\n\\nHank(on the news): This is clearly an ongoing operation, one which was well organized.\\n\\nWalter: Hank, how much money is that?\\n\\nHank: It's about 700 grand. That's a pretty good haul, huh?\\n\\nHank(on the news): As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque when we can put this big a dent in the local drug trade.\\n\\nWalter: Wow. But that's unusual, isn't it, that kind of cash?\\n\\nHank: Well, it's not the most we ever took. It's easy money until we catch you. Walt, just say the word and I'll take you on a ride-along. You can watch us knock down a meth lab. Get a little excitement in your life.\\n\\nWalter: Well, someday.\\n\\nScene: Walt and Skyler\u2019s Bedroom\\n\\nWalter: Which one's this?\\n\\nSkyler: That faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the Super-Swap.\\n\\nWalter: How's it doing?\\n\\nSkyler: I met my reserve, and there's still two minutes.\\n\\nWalter: What's up?\\n\\nSkyler: You tell me, birthday boy. Oh, hey, so what's up for Saturday?\\n\\nWalter: Car wash. Bogdan says he needs me.\\n\\nSkyler: Until what time? Noon? 1-ish?\\n\\nWalter: Probably 2, more like it.\\n\\nSkyler: And then what after that?\\n\\nWalter: Actually I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos. The visitor center has an exhibit on that\u2019s really supposed to be...\\n\\nSkyler: You're not gonna paint?\\n\\nWalter: I'll paint. It's just that this part of this exhibition on the Mars Rover photographs are the detail really is just supposed to be amazing.\\n\\nSkyler: It's just that I really need you to paint at some point. I mean, the sooner that back bedroom gets finished. And I'd do it myself, except you said you don't want me standing on the stepladder.\\n\\nWalter: I'll paint. I will paint.\\n\\nSkyler: What is going on down there?\\n\\nWalter: No, it's just...\\n\\nSkyler: Is he asleep?\\n\\nWalter: No, It's nothing. You know, just you know, we gotta be careful about the baby.\\n\\nSkyler: Don't worry about the baby. This is just for you. We are just doing you tonight. So just close your eyes. Relax, and let it. Close your eyes.\\n\\nWalter: Okay.\\n\\nSkyler: There you go. That's it. That's it. There you go. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep it going. Keep Yes! 56!\\n\\nScene: Ambulance\\n\\nWalter: This is so embarrassing. I am fine. Honestly. It's just some bug going around. First my wife had it, then my son, and now me. It's just like a chest cold. Could be some low blood sugar as well. I didn't have the greatest breakfast this morning, honestly. Hey, listen, can you do me a favor? Can you just drop me off at a corner somewhere?\\n\\nEMT: No. Sorry.\\n\\nWalter: It's just that I don't have the greatest insurance.\\n\\nEMT: Take a couple of deep breaths for me. Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?\\n\\nWalter: God, no.\\n\\nEMT: Lean forward for me, would you? Mr. White, are you a smoker?\\n\\nWalter: No. Never. Why do you ask?\\n\\nScene: Doctor\u2019s Office\\n\\nDoctor: Mr. White. Mr. White?\\n\\nWalter: Yes.\\n\\nDoctor: You understood what I've just said to you?\\n\\nWalter: Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.\\n\\nDoctor: I'm sorry I just need to make sure you fully understand.\\n\\nWalter: Best-case scenario, with chemo, I'll live maybe another couple years. It's just you've got mustard on your...right there. Mustard, there. Right there.\\n\\nScene: White Residence\\n\\nSkyler: So my records show that I paid it, and I certainly don't feel that we owe any late...All right. Well, I'll check with the bank and maybe the post office, if they lost it or something. Yeah, let me look into that. Okay. Thank you. Did you use the MasterCard last month?\\n\\nWalter: We needed printer paper.\\n\\nSkyler: Walt, the MasterCard's the one we don't use.\\n\\nWalter: Okay.\\n\\nSkyler: So how was your day?\\n\\nWalter: Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It was, um it was fine.\\n\\nScene: Car Wash\\n\\nBogdan: Come on. I'm shorthanded. I need you to do some wipe-downs. Come on.\\n\\nWalter: What?\\n\\nBogdan: I said I need you outside to do some wipe-downs. Are you here to work or to be staring at the skies? Come on, let's go. Come on, man.\\n\\nWalter: f*ck you, Bogdan.\\n\\nBogdan: What?\\n\\nWalter: I said f*ck you! And your eyebrows! Wipe down this!\\n\\nScene: White Residence-backyard\\n\\nWalter: Uh, Hank. Hank, it's Walt. Hey. Oh, listen I didn't wake you, did I? Oh, good, good. No, no, nothing's wrong. I just, uh I've been, uh, thinking about that offer that ride-along.\\n\\nScene: Hank\u2019s Car\\n\\nHank: It's the last house on the right. See it? Not the two-story one. The one next to it. The kind of I don't know, what do you call that? Green?\\n\\nSteve: Sage.\\n\\nHank: Sage. What, do you work at the f*cking Pottery Barn? Jesus.\\n\\nSteve: Sage. That's the word for it. My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green?\\n\\nHank: Cheese dick. I know that one. How 'bout that? Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?\\n\\nWalter: So what tells you it's a meth lab?\\nHank: Just our snitch. Says some dude goes by Cap'n Cook lives up to his name in there. Says he always adds a dash of chili powder. Ah, you exuberant Mexicans.\\n\\nSteve: Uh-uh. Cap\u2019n Cook, that's a white boy's name. Dopey as hell, too.\\n\\nHank: Yeah? Tell you what. I got 20 bucks that says he's a beaner.\\n\\nSteve: All right. You're on.\\n\\nHank: All right, come on, come on. All right. School bus is clear. Got the green light.\\n\\nAgent: Copy that.\\n\\nHank: Watch this. This makes 'em shit.\\n\\nAgent: Go, go, go.\\n\\nHank: Meth labs are nasty on a good day. You mix that shit wrong, you got mustard gas.\\n\\nWalter: Phosphine gas. I think.\\n\\nHank: Yeah, exactly. One whiff will k*ll you. That's why the respirators.\\n\\nAgent: House is clear. One suspect in custody.\\n\\nHank: Copy that. The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?\\n\\nAgent: Driver's license says Emilio Koyama.\\n\\nSteve: Asian! Pay up, sucker.\\n\\nHank: Hey hey hey! First name Emilio. That's at least half a beaner. Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10. Cheer up, Gomey. You people still got J. Lo.\\n\\nWalter: Hank, do you think I might get to go inside? See the actual lab?\\n\\nHank: Yeah. Yeah, I tell you what, we're gonna go peek our heads in, check it out first. Stay here a minute.\\n\\nJesse: God.\\n\\nWalter: Oh, my God. Pinkman?\\n\\nScene: Jesse\u2019s House\\n\\nWalter: It's me. I'm alone.\\n\\nJesse: How'd you find me?\\n\\nWalter: You're still in our filing system. So your aunt owns this place, right?\\n\\nJesse: I own it.\\n\\nWalter: No one's looking for you.\\n\\nJesse: Why are you here?\\n\\nWalter: I was curious. Honestly, I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn't picture that. There's a lot of money in it, huh?\\n\\nJesse: I don't know what you're talking about.\\n\\nWalter: No?\\n\\nJesse: Not a clue.\\n\\nWalter: Cap'n Cook? That's not you? Like I said, no one is looking for you.\\n\\nJesse: Look, I don't know what you think you're doing here, Mr. White. I mean, if you're planning on giving me some bowl winder about getting right with Jesus by turning myself in...\\n\\nWalter: Not really.\\n\\nJesse: High school was a long time ago. You ain't Welcome Back Kotter, so step off. No speeches.\\n\\nWalter: Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name? Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square 1. But you know the business. And I know the chemistry. I'm thinking maybe you and I could partner up.\\n\\nJesse: You want to cook crystal meth? You? You and, uh and me?\\n\\nWalter: That's right. Either that or I turn you in.\\n\\nScene: White Residence\\n\\nMarie: What the hell is this?\\n\\nSkyler: Damned if I know. I described it as mosaic folk art.\\n\\nMarie: Somebody bought it?\\n\\nSkyler: Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. 14 dollars plus shipping.\\n\\nMarie: Yes! At this rate, in 50 or 60 years, you'll be rich. So how goes the novel?\\n\\nSkyler: It's not a novel, actually, which I have...\\n\\nMarie: You're not writing a novel? You told me you were.\\n\\nSkyler: No. Short stories. I said that if eventually I have enough good ones that maybe I'll try and publish another collection.\\n\\nMarie: Those really didn't sell. I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.\\n\\nSkyler: Yeah, well, maybe so.\\n\\nMarie: Ever want me to read anything, I could critique it for you.\\n\\nSkyler: No. I mean, I'm not at that stage where I...no.\\n\\nMarie: Open offer. So what's up with Walt lately?\\n\\nSkyler: What do you mean? He's fine.\\n\\nMarie: He just seems, I don't know, quieter than usual.\\n\\nSkyler: Turning 50 is a big deal. I mean, I'm sure as hell not looking forward to 40. You're gonna be a complete basket case.\\n\\nMarie: So it's a mid-life crisis.\\n\\nSkyler: No, he's just quiet.\\n\\nMarie: How's the sex?\\n\\nSkyler: Marie, Jesus.\\n\\nMarie: Guess that answers that.\\n\\n\\nScene: Jesse\u2019s House\\n\\nWalter: You just gonna sit there? This. Look at this. Kjeldahl-style recovery flask, Very rare. You got your usual paraphernalia: Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask. But the piece de resistance: a round bottom boiling flask.\\n\\nJesse: Well, I cook in one of those. The big one.\\n\\nWalter: One of these? No, this is a volumetric flask. You wouldn't cook in one of these.\\n\\nJesse: Yeah, I do.\\n\\nWalter: No, you don't. A volumetric flask is for general mixing and titration. You wouldn't apply heat to a volumetric flask. That's what a boiling flask is for. Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?\\n\\nJesse: No. You flunked me. Remember?\\n\\nWalter: No wonder.\\n\\nJesse: Prick. Now let me tell you something else. This ain't chemistry, this is art. Cooking is art. And the shit I cook is the b*mb, so don't be telling me.\\n\\nWalter: The shit you cook is shit. I saw your setup. Ridiculous. You and I will not make garbage. We will produce a chemically pure and s*ab product that performs as advertised. No adulterants. No baby formula. No chili powder.\\n\\nJesse: No, no, chili P is my signature.\\n\\nWalter: Not anymore.\\n\\nJesse: Yeah, well, we'll see about that. What the hell is this?\\n\\nWalter: Lab safety equipment. We're also gonna have an emergency eye wash station. These chemicals and their fumes are toxic, in case you didn't know that.\\n\\nJesse: Well, you can dress up like a f*g if you want. Not me. Listen, this stuff doesn't stay more than a day.\\n\\nWalter: What? I thought we were gonna cook here.\\n\\nJesse: No, we're not gonna cook here. Okay, this is my house. I don't shit where I eat.\\n\\nWalter: Well, then, where are we gonna work?\\n\\nJesse: You tell me. This is your deal. You want to smoke it up, smoke it up at your house. Nah, I didn't think so.\\n\\nWalter: Oh, well. Well what if we rented one of those self-storage places, you know, those little orange garages, worked out of there?\\n\\nJesse: No. They're on to that. They got dogs that sniff around. RV. That's what you want.\\n\\nWalter: What, like a Winnebago?\\n\\nJesse: Yeah. I know a dude who wants to sell his. He just goes camping with it. But a mobile meth lab? That'd be the b*mb. I mean, drive way out in the boonies. Be all evasive.\\n\\nScene: Bank Parking Lot\\n\\nJesse: Dude, this isn't even 7 grand. My guy wants 85.\\n\\nWalter: This is all the money I have in the world. You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.\\n\\nJesse: You are not how I remember you from class, I mean, like, not at all.\\n\\nWalter: I gotta go.\\n\\nJesse: Wait, wait. Hold on. Tell me why you're doing this. Seriously.\\n\\nWalter: Why do you do it?\\n\\nJesse: Money, mainly.\\n\\nWalter: There you go.\\n\\nJesse: Nah, come on! Man, some straight like you, giant stick up his ass, all of a sudden at age, what, 60, he's just gonna break bad?\\n\\nWalter: I'm 50.\\n\\nJesse: It's weird is all, okay? It doesn't compute. Listen if you've gone crazy or something I mean, if you've if you've gone crazy or depressed, I'm just saying that's something I need to know about. Okay? I mean, that affects me.\\n\\nWalter: I am awake.\\n\\nJesse: What?\\n\\nWalter: Buy the RV. We start tomorrow.\\n\\nScene: The Mall\\n\\nSkyler: How's it coming in there?\\n\\nWalter Jr: Fine.\\n\\nSkyler: Do you want me or your dad?\\n\\nWalter Jr: Dad.\\n\\nSkyler: So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight? 'Cause you don't want to get 'em if they're too tight.\\n\\nWalter Jr: They're pre-shrunk.\\n\\nSkyler: Are you sure you don't want to get a different kind? Like, you know, the skinny jeans? Those are really supposed to be in style now. The skaters wear them.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Do I look like a skater?\\n\\nSkyler: All right.\\n\\nTeenager: Mom, look at my big-boy pants. Mommy, could you zip up my big-boy pants?\\n\\nWalter: Don't.\\n\\nSkyler: What?\\n\\nWalter: Don't.\\n\\nSkyler: Walt.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Where...\\n\\nSkyler: I have no idea. You know what? Don't even look at them. They're obviously very stupid. Yep. I think that, um I think those jeans look really good on you. You should get 'em if you like 'em, okay? Why don't you just hang out here for a second? I'll be right back.\\n\\nWalter Jr: Fine.\\n\\nTeenager: Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf in my brand-new big-boy pants. What are you doing?\\n\\nWalter: What's wrong, chief? Having a little trouble walking?\\n\\nTeenager: Get off me. Get off me! I'll mess you up, man.\\n\\nWalter: Well, you'll have one sh*t. You better make it good. What, are you waiting for your girlfriends? You better go. Take it. Take your sh*t. Take it! Come on. Come on.\\n\\nTeenager: Come on, let's get outta here. Let's go. Psycho.\\n\\nScene: Desert\\n\\nJesse: Yeah, nothing but cows! Got some big cow house way out that way, like 2 miles, but I don't see nobody.\\n\\nWalter: Cow house?\\n\\nJesse: Yeah, where they live. The cows. Whatever, man. Yeah, let's cook here.\\n\\nWalter: Cow house. God help me.\\n\\nJesse: What are you doing?\\n\\nWalter: These are my good clothes. I can't go home smelling like a meth lab.\\n\\nJesse: Yeah, you can. I do. Those? Those, uh You're keeping those on, right?\\n\\nWalter: Come on. Daylight's burning.\\n\\nJesse: Oh, my God. Oh, this is, uh this is a good look for you. And you're maybe only the world's second biggest h*m*.\\n\\nWalter: Would you shut up and help me?\\n\\nJesse: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, work it. Baby, work it.\\n\\nWalter: Turn that off!\\n\\nJesse: This is glass grade. I mean, you got...Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long. This is pure glass. You're a g*dd*mn artist. This is art, Mr. White.\\n\\nWalter: Actually, it's just basic chemistry, but thank you, Jesse. I'm glad it's acceptable.\\n\\nJesse: Acceptable? You're the g*dd*mn Iron Chef. Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu is going to want a taste. Now I gotta try this.\\n\\nWalter: No. No. No, we only sell it. We don't use it.\\n\\nJesse: Okay, since when? Listen, you've been watching way too much Miami Vice. That ain't happening.\\n\\nWalter: So what now? How do we proceed?\\n\\nJesse: We cook more tomorrow. Meantime I know just the guy to talk to.\\n\\nScene: Krazy-8\u2019s House\\n\\nJesse: Kraze, how you doing, my man? You got a new dog. Right on, man. What's his name? Yeah, I had a dog like that once, except maybe, like, twice as big. Super purebred. Now, me personally, I would train him to go straight for the nuts...\\n\\nKrazy-8: Just shut your mouth and show me your money.\\n\\nJesse: I ain't buying, ese. I'm selling. Tell me that ain't the finest scante you ever laid eyes on. Go ahead, try it. Hey, poochie. How you doing? Jesus Christ. See? What'd I say?\\n\\nKrazy-8: It's all right.\\n\\nJesse: It's all right? It's all right?\\n\\nKrazy-8: Yeah, it's all right. So, what? You back in business?\\n\\nJesse: Hell, yeah, I'm back. With a vengeance. Vato loco gotta make a living. You know, with your cousin gone away and all. And listen, homes, about that. It really broke me up about Emilio. That dude is like my brother. He okay? You talk to him?\\n\\nKrazy-8: Yeah, yeah, I talked to him. He said when the Feds came, you were out sticking it in some neighbor lady.\\n\\nJesse: Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.\\n\\nKrazy-8: I don't know, man. Emilio, he thinks maybe you dimed on him.\\n\\nJesse: That is bullshit. That is bullshit, Krazy-8! I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that. You know what? Next time you talk to Emilio, you tell him for me, all right?\\n\\nKrazy-8: Why don't you tell him yourself? Made bail this morning.\\n\\nEmilio: Go ahead, pendejo. Kick my ass.\\n\\nJesse: Hey, listen...\\n\\nKrazy-8: Where did you get this? Because I know your little punk ass didn't cook it.\\n\\nScene: Desert\\n\\nKrazy-8: Hey, man. You some kind of nudist? That's some stone-fine tick tick you been cooking there, ese. How about you come work for me?\\n\\nWalter: I'd be willing to sell it to you if the price is right.\\n\\nKrazy-8: You out here all by yourself, huh?\\n\\nEmilio: I know you. He was there when I got busted. He's with the DEA!\\n\\nWalter: No.\\n\\nEmilio: You ratasnitch f*ck!\\n\\nJesse: Run, Mr. White! Run!\\n\\nEmilio: I say we cap 'em both.\\n\\nKrazy-8: Hey, you really cook up that batch?\\n\\nWalter: Yeah.\\n\\nKrazy-8: You an artist. It's a damn shame.\\n\\nWalter: Wait! Wait a minute. Listen to me. I'll teach you my recipe. What do you say? You want to cook like me? You let us both live and I will teach you. Put the cigarette out. Please.\\n\\nEmilio: Move it, homes. We ain't got all day.\\n\\nWalter: Okay.\\n\\nJesse: What happened? What'd you do to them?\\n\\nWalter: Red phosphorus in the presence of moisture and accelerated by heat yields phosphorus hydride. Phosphine gas. One good whiff and...we gotta, we gotta clean this up.\\n\\nScene: Walt and Skyler\u2019s Bedroom\\n\\nSkyler: Where were you? Walt. I don't know what's been going on with you lately, but...\\n\\nWalter: Nothing. I'm fine.\\n\\nSkyler: Whatever it is, I'll tell you this. I do not like it when you don't talk to me.

But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.\\n\\nStanley: In January?\\n\\nMichael: It's cheaper.\\nMichael: This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.\\nMichael: It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!\\n\\nMeredith: All right!\\n\\nRyan: I have a test for business school tomorrow night. Is it okay if I skip the cruise and study for that?\\n\\nMichael: No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.\\n\\nRyan: I'm already in business school.\\n\\nMichael: Well, this...\\n\\nKelly: Wait, Michael?\\n\\nMichael: Yeah?\\n\\nKelly: Why did you tell us to bring a bathing suit?\\n\\nMichael: To throw you off the scent.\\n\\nKelly: Yeah, but I bought a bathing suit.\\n\\nMichael: Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.\\n\\nKelly: I took the tags off already.\\n\\nMichael: Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.\\nMichael: I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.\\nMichael: Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!\\nOscar: Last year, Michael's theme was 'Bowl over the Competition!' So guess where we went.\\nMichael: Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?\\n\\nDarryl: How about the sales department is the sails?\\n\\nMichael: Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.\\n\\nPhyllis: A furnace?\\n\\nJim: Yeesh, how old is this ship?\\n\\nPam: How about the anchor?\\n\\nPhyllis: What does the furnace do?\\n\\nMichael: All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!\\n\\nJim: I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?\\n\\nMichael: Titanic?\\n\\nPam: I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.\\n\\nMichael: No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!\\nJim: Michael stands in the front of the boat and says that he's king of the world within the first hour, or I give you my next paycheck.\\nPhyllis: Michael, everyone in the engine room drowned.\\n\\nMichael: No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.\\n\\nDarryl: What?\\n\\nMichael: The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.\\n\\nDwight: Aye aye, Captain.\\nMichael: [singing] A three-hour tour, a three-hour tour.\\nMichael: Pam, you are Mary Ann! We have the Professor and Ginger, welcome aboard. Angela, you are Mrs. Howell. Lovey. [to Kelly] Uh... the native. Sometimes they come from neighboring... [to Stanley] We have one of the Globetrotters, I am the Skipper, and Dwight, you will be Gilligan.\\n\\nDwight: Cool.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Actually, I'm the Skipper. But you can be Gilligan.\\n\\nMichael: I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: I am Captain Jack, I am captain of the ship. I'm also captain of anyone who sets foot on the ship. [to boarding passengers] Hi, welcome aboard.\\n\\nMichael: Okay.\\nMichael: In an office, when you are ranking people, manager is higher than captain. On a boat, who knows? It's nebulose.\\nMichael: Hey, look! I'm king of the world!\\nCaptain Jack: Okay, all right! Welcome aboard! I am your captain, Captain Jack.\\n\\nMichael: And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Okay! So...\\n\\nMichael: Okay! So...\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Please. The life preservers.\\n\\nMichael: Right.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: They are located underneath the seats, all along the border of the boat.\\n\\nMichael: But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Well, we might, okay? Please let me finish, okay? Thank you. So, the Coast Guard requires that I tell you where the safety exits are. On this ship, it's very easy. Anywhere over the side. [Dwight laughs loudly.] Not only am I your ship captain, I am also your party captain! Whoo! We're gonna get it going in just a few minutes here...\\n\\nMichael: I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Okay, Michael, if you don't mind...\\n\\nMichael: Rock it!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Please, okay?\\n\\nMichael: If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Michael.\\n\\nMichael: Yep.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Your company's employees are not the only people on the boat tonight, okay?\\n\\nMichael: We're all gonna have a good time tonight!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Why don't you let me and my crew do our job. You just sit back and have a good time. All right?\\n\\nMichael: Hm? Okay. Yep.\\nKaty: You guys, it's like we're in high school and we're at the cool table. Right?\\n\\nRoy: Yeah.\\n\\nKaty: Pam, were you a cheerleader?\\n\\nRoy: No, she was totally Miss Artsy-Fartsy in high school. She wore the turtleneck and everything!\\n\\nKaty: That's hilarious.\\n\\nJim: It's not hilarious, but...\\n\\nRoy: Where did you go to school?\\n\\nKaty: Bishop O'Hara.\\n\\nRoy: Piss slop who cares-a? We played you! You... you really look familiar. Did you... you cheered for them, didn't you?\\n\\nJim: Um, no.\\n\\nKaty: Yes, I did! [chanting] A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Awesome! Awesome is what we are! We're the football superstars! A-W-E-S-O-M-E!\\n\\nRoy: I remember that! We crushed you like 42-10!\\nMichael: Having fun?\\n\\nBrenda: Yeah. Everybody's really nice.\\n\\nMichael: Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.\\n\\nBrenda: When are you going to start the presentation?\\n\\nMichael: Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Not now, Mike, we're doing the limbo! That's right, partiers, it's time to limbo, limbo, limbo!\\n\\nMichael: So, okay.\\n\\nDwight: Limbo, whoo!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: All right! I need a volunteer to come up here and hold my stick. Who's it gonna be?\\n\\nMeredith: Me.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Okay...\\n\\nDwight: Me! Me, me, me.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Uh... usually it's a woman.\\n\\nDwight: I'm stronger.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Hey, I got an idea! How would you like to steer the ship, Dwight?\\nCaptain Jack: Keep us on a steady course. Keep a sharp eye out. I'm counting on you!\\nDwight: I was the youngest pilot in Pan Am history. When I was four, the pilot let me ride in the cockpit and fly the plane with him. And I was four. And I was great. And I would have landed it, but my dad wanted us to go back to our seats.\\nCaptain Jack: All right, all right, that was great! Now it's time for the dance contest!\\n\\nMichael: But before that, I have to do my presentation.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Nope! Dance contest!\\n\\nMichael: All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!\\nMichael: Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss that's always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you have to just be the boss of dancing.\\nDwight: [singing] What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor? What do you do with a drunken sailor early in the morning?\\n\\nAngela: Hey, come inside and talk to me.\\n\\nDwight: I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!\\nDarryl and Katy: [chanting] Snorkel sh*t! Snorkel sh*t!\\n\\nRoy: Whoo! Who's next? Come on, Pam! Come on! Come on!\\n\\nPam: No, I'm not going to do that.\\n\\nRoy: Come on!\\n\\nDarryl: That's what I'm talking about!\\n\\nPam: Hey, why don't we find like a quieter place to hang out?\\n\\nRoy: I've just gotta wait for Darryl to do his sh*t. Just a minute. Come on! [chanting] Darryl! Darryl!\\nPam: It's getting kind of rowdy down there.\\n\\nJim: Yeah. [chanting] Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!\\n\\nPam: Sometimes I just don't get Roy.\\n\\nJim: Well...\\n\\nPam: I mean, I don't know. So... what's it like dating a cheerleader?\\n\\nJim: Oh, um... [A long silence.]\\n\\nPam: I'm cold.\\nCaptain Jack: So, what's this presentation all about?\\n\\nMichael: Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Women and children.\\n\\nMichael: No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: That's a stupid analogy.\\n\\nMichael: Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Well, I was the captain of a PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat during Desert Storm.\\n\\nDwight: Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.\\n\\nMichael: Okay.\\n\\nDwight: Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.\\nKaty: I'd like to be engaged. How did you manage to pull that off?\\n\\nPam: Uh, I've been engaged for three years, and there's no end in sight. So... you don't wanna ask my advice.\\nCaptain Jack: Suppose your office building's on fire. Jim, who would you save?\\n\\nJim: Um... let's see, uh... The customer. Because the customer is king.\\n\\nMichael: Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.\\n\\nCaptain Jack: He's just sucking up!\\n\\nRoy: When you were in the Navy, did you ever almost die?\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Oh yeah, oh yeah. And I wasn't thinking about some customer. I was thinking about my first wife. The day I got back on shore, I married her.\\nJim: You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.\\nRoy: Hello, everybody, could I have your attention for just a second? Could you listen to me for a second? We were up at the front, and we were talking about what's really important, and... Pam, I think enough is enough. I think we should set a date for our wedding. How about June 10th? Come on, let's do it! Come on, Pam!\\nMichael: I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?\\n\\nRoy: No, it was Captain Jack.\\n\\nMichael: Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!\\n\\nCaptain Jack: We gotta celebrate! Hey, I got an idea, I got an idea. I can marry you right now, as captain of the ship!\\n\\nMichael: Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!\\n\\nPam: No, no, I want my mom and dad to be there.\\n\\nMichael: Then I'll give you away!\\n\\nPam: No, thank you.\\nKaty: Do you think that'll ever be us?\\n\\nJim: No.\\n\\nKaty: What is wrong with you? Why did you even bring me here tonight?\\n\\nJim: I don't know. Let's break up.\\n\\nKaty: Whoa. What?\\nCaptain Jack: This is where Captain Jack drives the boat.\\n\\nMeredith: Wow!\\nDwight: Seasick? Captain Jack says you should look at the Moon.\\n\\nMichael: Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.\\n\\nBrenda: Really? What?\\n\\nMichael: Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...\\n\\nCaptain Jack: Hey! Hey! What the hell is going on here?\\n\\nMichael: It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.\\nMichael: I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.\\nMichael: Is somebody there?\\n\\nJim: What happened to you?\\n\\nMichael: Captain Jack has a problem with authority.\\n\\nJim: Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?\\n\\nMichael: He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.\\n\\nJim: What a night.\\n\\nMichael: Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.\\n\\nJim: She was always engaged.\\n\\nMichael: Roy said the first one didn't count.\\n\\nJim: That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so...\\n\\nMichael: Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...\\n\\nJim: Yeah, I know.\\n\\nMichael: Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.\\n\\nJim: Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.\\n\\nMichael: Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.\\n\\nJim: She's engaged.\\n\\nMichael: BFD. Engaged ain't married.\\n\\nJim: Huh.\\n\\nMichael: Never, ever, ever give up.\\nDwight: Don't worry, Michael. I'm taking us to shore.\\n\\nMichael: It's a fake wheel, dummy.\\n\"\n  - text: \"PROLOGUE\\n\\nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nLawrence, Kansas\\n\\n22 years ago\\n\\nThese scenes are definitively dated to 2 Nov 2005.\\n\\nCrickets chirp. A large deciduous tree with no leaves stands outside one of several suburban homes.\\n\\nINT. NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nA Woman, Mary Winchester, wearing a white nightgown, carries a SMALL CHILD, her son Dean, into a dark room.\\n\\nMary: Come on, let's say good night to your brother.\\n\\nMary turns on the lights: it's the nursery of a BABY, Sam, who is lying in his crib and looking over at Mary and Dean. Mary sets Dean down. Dean leans over the side of the crib and kisses Sam on the forehead.\\n\\nDean: 'Night, Sam.\\n\\nMary leans over Sam as well.\\n\\nMary: Good night, love.\\n\\nMary brushes Sam's hair back and kisses his forehead.\\n\\nMan: Hey, Dean.\\n\\nDean turns. The Man in the doorway wearing a USMC T-shirt is John. Dean rushes over to him.\\n\\nDean: Daddy!\\n\\nJohn: Hey, buddy.\\n\\nJohn scoops Dean up.\\n\\nJohn: So what do you think? You think Sammy's ready to toss around a football yet?\\n\\nDean shakes his head, laughing.\\n\\nDean: No, Daddy.\\n\\nJohn laughs.\\n\\nJohn: No.\\n\\nMary passes John and Dean on the way out of the room.\\n\\nMary: You got him?\\n\\nJohn: I got him.\\n\\nJohn hugs Dean closer.\\n\\nJohn: Sweet dreams, Sam.\\n\\nJohn carries Dean out of the room, flipping off the lights. Sam watches them go, gurgling, then tries to reach his toes.\\n\\nThe baseball-themed mobile above Sam's crib begins to spin on its own while Sam watches. The transportation-themed clock on the wall ticks, ticks, stops. The moon-shaped nightlight flickers.\\n\\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nLights flicker on a baby monitor sitting on a nightstand next to a photo of Mary and John. Strange noises come through the monitor. Mary, asleep in bed, stirs. She turns on the light on the nightstand.\\n\\nMary: John?\\n\\nMary turns: she's alone. She gets up.\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nMary walks down the hall to Sam's nursery. John, seen only in silhouette, stands over Sam's crib.\\n\\nMary: John? Is he hungry?\\n\\nJohn turns his head.\\n\\nMan: Shhh.\\n\\nMary: All right.\\n\\nMary heads back down the hallway. The light by the stairs is flickering. Mary frowns and goes to tap at it till the light steadies.\\n\\nMary: Hm.\\n\\nMore flickering light is coming from downstairs: Mary investigates. A w*r movie is on TV and John has fallen asleep watching it. If John is here, Mary realizes, then the Man upstairs cannot be John and must be a danger. She runs back upstairs.\\n\\nMary: Sammy! Sammy!\\n\\nMary enters Sam's nursery and stops short.\\n\\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nUpstairs, Mary screams. John wakes up.\\n\\nJohn: Mary?\\n\\nJohn scrambles out of the chair.\\n\\nJohn: Mary!\\n\\nJohn runs upstairs.\\n\\nINT. NURSERY - NIGHT\\n\\nJohn bursts through the closed door of the nursery.\\n\\nJohn: Mary.\\n\\nThe room is quiet and appears empty except for Sam awake in his crib and John. John glances around and pushes down the side of Sam's crib.\\n\\nJohn: Hey, Sammy. You okay?\\n\\nSomething dark drips next to Sam. John touches it. Two more drops land on the back of John's hand. It looks like blood. John looks up. Mary is sprawled across the ceiling, the stomach of her nightgown red with blood, staring at John and struggling to breathe. John collapses onto the floor, staring at Mary.\\n\\nJohn: No! Mary!\\n\\nMary bursts into flame. The fire spreads over the ceiling. John stares, frozen. Sam wails. John, reminded he's not alone, gets up and scoops Sam out of his crib and rushes out of the room.\\n\\nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\\n\\nDean is awake and coming to investigate.\\n\\nDean: Daddy!\\n\\nJohn shoves Sam at Dean.\\n\\nJohn: Take your brother outside as fast as you can and don't look back! Now, Dean, go!\\n\\nDean turns and runs. John turns back to the nursery.\\n\\nJohn: Mary!\\n\\nThe entire room is on fire. Mary herself can barely be seen.\\n\\nJohn: No!\\n\\nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\\n\\nDean runs outside, holding Sam.\\n\\nDean: It's okay, Sammy.\\n\\nDean turns to look up at Sam's window, which is lit with gold.\\n\\nJohn runs outside, scoops up Dean and Sam, and carries them both away.\\n\\nJohn: I gotcha.\\n\\nFire explodes out of Sam's nursery window.\\n\\nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, LATER\\n\\nThe Lawrence fire department has arrived. A FIREFIGHTER gets out of a fire truck and takes over at the gauges for another firefighter.\\n\\nFirefighter: I got it. You go hold the line up.\\n\\nThe second firefighter goes to the back of the truck and takes a hose from a third firefighter. That firefighter takes the hose towards the house where a fourth firefighter is spraying through Sam's nursery window. A paramedic opens the back of an ambulance. A Police Officer waves some neighbors back.\\n\\nOfficer: Stay back. You have to stay back.\\n\\nAcross the street from the house, John and Dean sit on the hood of John's Impala, John holding Sam. John looks up at the remnants of the fire.\\n\\nACT ONE\\n\\nStanford University\\n\\nPresent Day\\n\\nIt is 31 Oct 2005.\\n\\n'Gasoline' by Ginger begins to play.\\n\\nAPARTMENT\\n\\nINT.

Everyone is in costume.\\n\\nGuest Starring\\n\\nSarah SHAHI\\n\\nMusic: Are you gonna ride\\n\\nJess raises a glass as a Young Man in a ghoul costume, Luis, comes up to the table where Sam and Jess are.

Jess shifts position.\\n\\nExecutive Producer\\n\\nMcG\\n\\nA sound outside the room, like a window opening. Sam opens his eyes.\\n\\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT\\n\\nSam leaves the bedroom and looks around the apartment.\\n\\nExecutive Producer\\n\\nDAVID NUTTER\\n\\nA window is open; earlier it must have been closed. Footsteps. A Man walks past the strings of beads at the far end of the hall. Sam moves to another part of the apartment and waits. The Man enters the room. Sam lunges forward and grabs the Man at the shoulder. The Man knocks Sam's arm away and aims a strike at Sam, who ducks. The Man grabs Sam's arm, swings him around, and shoves him back. Sam kicks and is blocked, then pushed back into another room. If the Man hadn't seen Sam's face before, he sees it now; Sam gets his first glimpse of the Man. The Man elbows Sam in the face; Sam kicks at his head. The Man ducks and swings and Sam blocks. The Man knocks Sam down and pins him to the floor, one hand at Sam's neck and the other holding Sam's wrist.\\n\\nMan: Whoa, easy, tiger.\\n\\nSam breathes hard.\\n\\nSam: Dean?\\n\\nDean laughs.\\n\\nSam: You scared the crap out of me!\\n\\nDean: That's 'cause you're out of practice.\\n\\nSam grabs Dean's hand and yanks, slamming his heel into Dean's back and Dean to the floor.\\n\\nDean: Or not.\\n\\nSam taps Dean twice where Sam is holding him.\\n\\nDean: Get off of me.\\n\\nSam rolls to his feet and pulls Dean up.\\n\\nSam: What the hell are you doing here?\\n\\nDean: Well, I was looking for a beer.\\n\\nProduced by\\n\\nCYRUS YAVNEH\\n\\nDean puts his hands on Sam's shoulders, shakes once, and lets go.\\n\\nSam: What the hell are you doing here?\\n\\nDean: Okay. All right. We gotta talk.\\n\\nCreated by\\n\\nERIC KRIPKE\\n\\nSam: Uh, the phone?\\n\\nDean: If I'd'a called, would you have picked up?\\n\\nJess turns the light on. She is wearing very short shorts and a cropped Smurfs shirt.\\n\\nJess: Sam?\\n\\nSam and Dean turn their heads in unison.\\n\\nSam: Jess. Hey. Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica.\\n\\nDean looks at her appreciatively.\\n\\nJess: Wait, your brother Dean?\\n\\nJess smiles. Sam nods. Dean grins at her and moves closer.\\n\\nDean: Oh, I love the Smurfs. You know, I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother's league.\\n\\nJess: Just let me put something on.\\n\\nJess turns to go. Dean's voice stops her.\\n\\nWritten by\\n\\nERIC KRIPKE\\n\\nDean: No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously.\\n\\nDean goes back over to Sam without taking his eyes off Jess. Sam watches him, his expression stony.\\n\\nDean: Anyway, I gotta borrow your boyfriend here, talk about some private family business.\\n\\nDirected by\\n\\nDAVID NUTTER\\n\\nDean: But, uh, nice meeting you.\\n\\nSam: No.\\n\\nSam goes over to Jess and puts an arm around her.\\n\\nSam: No, whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of her.\\n\\nDean: Okay.\\n\\nDean turns to look at them both straight on.\\n\\nDean: Um. Dad hasn't been home in a few days.\\n\\nSam: So he's working overtime on a Miller Time shift. He'll stumble back in sooner or later.\\n\\nDean ducks his head and looks back up.\\n\\nDean: Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days.\\n\\nSam's expression doesn't change while he takes this in. Jess glances up at him.\\n\\nSam: Jess, excuse us. We have to go outside.\\n\\nOUTSIDE APARTMENT\\n\\nINT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT\\n\\nSam and Dean head downstairs. Sam has put on jeans and a hoodie.\\n\\nSam: I mean, come on. You can't just break in, middle of the night, and expect me to hit the road with you.\\n\\nDean: You're not hearing me, Sammy. Dad's missing. I need you to help me find him.\\n\\nSam: You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the Devil's Gates in Clifton? He was missing then, too. He's always missing, and he's always fine.\\n\\nDean stops and turns around. Sam stops too.\\n\\nDean: Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with me or not?\\n\\nSam: I'm not.\\n\\nDean: Why not?\\n\\nSam: I swore I was done hunting. For good.\\n\\nDean: Come on. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad.\\n\\nDean starts downstairs again. Sam follows.\\n\\nSam: Yeah? When I told Dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45.\\n\\nDean stops at the door to the outside.\\n\\nDean: Well, what was he supposed to do?\\n\\nSam: I was nine years old! He was supposed to say, don't be afraid of the dark.\\n\\nDean: Don't be afraid of the dark? Are you kidding me? Of course you should be afraid of the dark. You know what's out there.\\n\\nSam: Yeah, I know, but still. The way we grew up, after Mom was k*ll, and Dad's obsession to find the thing that k*ll her.\\n\\nDean glances outside.\\n\\nSam: But we still haven't found the damn thing. So we k*ll everything we canfind.\\n\\nDean: We save a lot of people doing it, too.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\nSam: You think Mom would have wanted this for us?\\n\\nDean rolls his eyes and slams the door open.\\n\\nEXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT\\n\\nThere's a short flight of stairs from the door to the parking lot. Dean and Sam climb it.\\n\\nSam: The w*apon training, and melting the silver into b*ll*ts? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors.\\n\\nThey cross the parking lot to the Impala from the prologue.\\n\\nDean: So what are you gonna do? You're just gonna live some normal, apple pie life? Is that it?\\n\\nSam: No. Not normal. Safe.\\n\\nDean: And that's why you ran away.\\n\\nDean looks away.\\n\\nSam: I was just going to college. It was Dad who said if I was gonna go I should stay gone. And that's what I'm doing.\\n\\nDean: Yeah, well, Dad's in real trouble right now. If he's not dead already. I can feel it.\\n\\nSam is silent.\\n\\nDean: I can't do this alone.\\n\\nSam: Yes you can.\\n\\nDean looks down.\\n\\nDean: Yeah, well, I don't want to.\\n\\nSam sighs and looks down, thinking, then up.\\n\\nSam: What was he hunting?\\n\\nDean opens the trunk of the Impala, then the spare-tire compartment. It's an arsenal. He props the compartment open with a g*n and digs through the clutter.\\n\\nDean: All right, let's see, where the hell did I put that thing?\\n\\nSam: So when Dad left, why didn't you go with him?\\n\\nDean: I was working my own gig. This, uh, voodoo thing, down in New Orleans.\\n\\nSam: Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself?\\n\\nDean looks over at Sam.\\n\\nDean: I'm twenty-six, dude.\\n\\nDean pulls some papers out of a folder.\\n\\nDean: All right, here we go. So Dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop just outside of Jericho, California. About a month ago, this guy.\\n\\nDean hands one of the papers to Sam.\\n\\nDean: They found his car, but he vanished. Completely MIA.\\n\\nThe paper is a printout of an article from the Jericho Herald, headlined 'Centennial Highway Disappearance' and dated Sept. 19th 2005; it has a man's picture, captioned 'Andrew Carey MISSING'. Sam reads it and glances up.\\n\\nSam: So maybe he was kidnapped.\\n\\nDean: Yeah. Well, here's another one in April.\\n\\nDean tosses down another Jericho Heraldarticle for each date he mentions.\\n\\nDean: Another one in December 'oh-four, 'oh-three, 'ninety-eight, 'ninety-two, ten of them over the past twenty years.\\n\\nDean takes the article back from Sam and picks up the rest of the stack, putting them back in the folder.\\n\\nDean: All men, all the Same five-mile stretch of road.\\n\\nDean pulls a bag out of another part of the arsenal.\\n\\nDean: It started happening more and more, so Dad went to go dig around. That was about three weeks ago. I hadn't heard from him since, which is bad enough.\\n\\nDean grabs a handheld tape recorder.\\n\\nDean: Then I get this voicemail yesterday.\\n\\nHe presses play. The recording is staticky and the signal was clearly breaking up.\\n\\nJohn: Dean...something big is starting to happen...I need to try and figure out what's going on. It may... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger.\\n\\nDean presses stop.\\n\\nSam: You know there's EVP on that?\\n\\nDean: Not bad, Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike, isn't it?\\n\\nSam shakes his head.\\n\\nDean: All right. I slowed the message down, I ran it through a gold wave, took out the hiss, and this is what I got.\\n\\nHe presses play again.\\n\\nWoman: I can never go home...\\n\\nDean presses stop.\\n\\nSam: Never go home.\\n\\nDean drops the recorder, puts down the g*n, stands straight, and shuts the trunk, then leans on it.\\n\\nDean: You know, in almost two years I've never bothered you, never asked you for a thing.\\n\\nSam looks away and sighs, then looks back.\\n\\nSam: All right. I'll go. I'll help you find him.\\n\\nDean nods.\\n\\nSam: But I have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.\\n\\nSam turns to go back to the apartment. He turns back when Dean speaks.\\n\\nDean: What's first thing Monday?\\n\\nSam: I have this...I have an interview.\\n\\nDean: What, a job interview? Skip it.\\n\\nSam: It's a law school interview, and it's my whole future on a plate.\\n\\nDean: Law school?\\n\\nDean smirks.\\n\\nSam: So we got a deal or not?\\n\\nDean says nothing.\\n\\nAPARTMENT\\n\\nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\\n\\nSam is packing a duffel bag. He pulls out a large hook-shaped knife and slides it inside. Jess comes into the room.\\n\\nJess: Wait, you're taking off?\\n\\nSam looks up.\\n\\nSam: Is this about your dad? Is he all right?\\n\\nSam: Yeah. You know, just a little family drama.\\n\\nSam goes over to the dresser and turns on the lamp atop it.\\n\\nJess: Your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.\\n\\nJess sits on the bed. Sam rummages in one of the drawers and comes out with a couple shirts, which go in the duffel.\\n\\nSam: Oh, yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin, he's probably got Jim, Jack, and Jos\u00e9 along with him. I'm just going to go bring him back.\\n\\nJess: What about the interview?\\n\\nSam: I'll make the interview. This is only for a couple days.\\n\\nSam goes around the bed. Jess gets up and follows.\\n\\nJess: Sam, I mean, please.\\n\\nSam stops and turns.\\n\\nJess: Just stop for a second. You sure you're okay?\\n\\nSam laughs a little.\\n\\nSam: I'm fine.\\n\\nJess: It's just...you won't even talk about your family. And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend a weekend with them? And with Monday coming up, which is kind of a huge deal.\\n\\nSam: Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I will be back in time, I promise.\\n\\nHe kisses her on the cheek and leaves.\\n\\nJess: At least tell me where you're going.\\n\"\ntags:\n- generated_from_trainer\nmetrics:\n- rouge\nmodel-index:\n- name: t5-base-finetuned-summscreen-bestval-100-genlen-10-epochs\n  results: []\n---\n\n<!-- This model card has been generated automatically according to the information the Trainer had access to.
