This model is a fine-tuned version of [t5-small](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) fine-tuned on a refined version of [190k Medium Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabiochiusano/medium-articles) dataset for generating Machine Learning article tags using the article textual content as input. While usually formulated as a multi-label classification problem, this model deals with _tag generation_ as a text2text generation task (inspiration and reference: [fabiochiu/t5-base-tag-generation](https://huggingface.co/fabiochiu/t5-base-tag-generation)).\n<br><br>\nFinetuning Notebook Reference: [Hugging face summarization notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/summarization.ipynb).\n# How to use the model\n### Installations\n\n```python\npip install transformers nltk\n```\n### Code\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('punkt')\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"nandakishormpai/t5-small-machine-articles-tag-generation\")\nmodel = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(\"nandakishormpai/t5-small-machine-articles-tag-generation\")\n\narticle_text = \"\"\"\nPaige, AI in pathology and genomics\n\nFundamentally transforming the diagnosis and treatment of cancer\nPaige has raised $25M in total.

GPT3 API was used to Tag those and then preprocessing on the generated tags was performed to enusre articles with 4 or 5 tags were selected for the final dataset that came around 940 articles.\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThis model can be used to generate Tags for Machine Learning articles primarily and can be used for other technical articles expecting a lesser accuracy and detail. The results might contain duplicate tags that must be handled in the postprocessing of results.\n\n## Results\n\nIt achieves the following results on the evaluation set:\n- Loss: 1.8786\n- Rouge1: 35.5143\n- Rouge2: 18.6656\n- Rougel: 32.7292\n- Rougelsum: 32.6493\n- Gen Len: 17.5745\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThe dataset of over 940 articles was split across train : val : test as 80:10:10 ratio samples. \n\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 2e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 16\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10\n- mixed_precision_training: Native AMP\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.26.1\n- Pytorch 1.13.1+cu116\n- Datasets 2.9.0\n- Tokenizers 0.13.2\n\n\n\n\n\n", "size_bytes": "242071641", "downloads": 85}
