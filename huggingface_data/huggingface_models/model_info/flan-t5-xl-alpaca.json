Some limitations include:\n\n- Language: The model is designed to work with English text only and may not perform as well in other languages.\n\n\nIn addition, the model may have some bias in terms of the data it was trained on. The dataset includes questions from a variety of sources, but it may not be representative of all populations or perspectives. As a result, the model may perform better or worse for certain types of questions or on certain types of texts.\n", "size_bytes": "11399214965", "downloads": 22}
