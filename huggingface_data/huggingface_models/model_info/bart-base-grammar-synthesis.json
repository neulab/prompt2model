You can install it using pip:\n\n```\npip install -U transformers\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Initialize the text-generation pipeline for text correction\ncorrector = pipeline(\"text2text-generation\", \"pszemraj/bart-base-grammar-synthesis\")\n\n# Example text to correct\nraw_text = \"The toweris 324 met (1,063 ft) tall, about height as .An 81-storey building, and biggest longest structure paris. Is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its constructiothe eiffel tower surpassed the washington monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 yearsuntilthe chryslerbuilding in new york city was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to goat a height of 300 metres. Due 2 the addition ofa brdcasting aerial at the t0pp of the twr in 1957, it now taller than  chrysler building 5.2 metres (17 ft). Exxxcluding transmitters,  eiffel tower is  2ndd tallest ree-standing structure in france after millau viaduct.\"\n\n# Correct the text using the text-generation pipeline\ncorrected_text = corrector(raw_text)[0][\"generated_text\"]\n\n# Print the corrected text\nprint(corrected_text)\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the text-generation pipeline to correct the grammar in a given text. The `corrector` pipeline is initialized with the \"pszemraj/bart-base-grammar-synthesis\" model, which is designed for grammar correction. The `corrector` pipeline takes the raw text as input and returns the corrected text. Make sure to install the required dependencies and models before running the code.\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\n- robust grammar correction\n- the model has a license of `cc-by-nc-sa-4.0` as it uses the JFLEG dataset + augments it for training\n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 0.0001\n- train_batch_size: 8\n- eval_batch_size: 8\n- seed: 42\n- distributed_type: multi-GPU\n- gradient_accumulation_steps: 16\n- total_train_batch_size: 128\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: cosine\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_ratio: 0.02\n- num_epochs: 3.0\n", "size_bytes": "557971229", "downloads": 351}
