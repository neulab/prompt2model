Gr\u03b5Ta is a T5-base sized, monolingual, encoder-decoder variant.  \n\nThis model was trained in two stages. Initially, it was pre-trained on a recently acquired corpus that leverages OCR scans obtained from the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).  Subsequently, the model was further trained using data from the [Open Greek & Latin Project](https://opengreekandlatin.org/), the CLARIN corpus [Greek Medieval Texts](https://inventory.clarin.gr/corpus/890), and the [Patrologia Graeca](https://patristica.net/graeca/).\n\n\nFurther information can be found in our paper or in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Heidelberg-NLP/ancient-language-models).\n\n## Usage\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForConditionalGeneration\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bowphs/GreTa')\nmodel = AutoModelForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('bowphs/GreTa')\n```\nPlease check out the awesome Hugging Face tutorials on how to fine-tune our models.\n\n## Evaluation Results\nWhen fine-tuned on data from [Universal Dependencies 2.10](https://universaldependencies.org/), Gr\u03b5Ta achieves the following results on the Ancient Greek Perseus dataset:\n\n| Task | XPoS | UPoS  | UAS | LAS | Lemma |\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|      |94.44|89.03|87.32|83.06|91.14|\n\nPlease note that the PoS tagging and dependency parsing results are obtained using _only_ the encoder component of the model.\n\n## Contact\nIf you have any questions or problems, feel free to [reach out](mailto:riemenschneider@cl.uni-heidelberg.de).\n\n## Citation\n```bibtex\n@incollection{riemenschneiderfrank:2023,\n    address = \"Toronto, Canada\",\n    author = \"Riemenschneider, Frederick and Frank, Anette\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL\u201923)\",\n    note = \"to appear\",\n    pubType = \"incollection\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    title = \"Exploring Large Language Models for Classical Philology\",\n    url = \"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13698\",\n    year = \"2023\",\n    key = \"riemenschneiderfrank:2023\"\n}\n```", "size_bytes": "990280781", "downloads": 4}
