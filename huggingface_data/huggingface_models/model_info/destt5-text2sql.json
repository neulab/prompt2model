This is prefaced by the `db_id`.\n\n```\n[db_id] | [sql]\n```\n\n\n### Performance\n\nWhen this model receives the serialized database schema as predicted by [destt5-schema-prediction](https://huggingface.co/parkervg/destt5-schema-prediction), it achieves 53.43% correction accuracy (exact-match) on the SPLASH test set. \n\n\n### References\n\n1.
