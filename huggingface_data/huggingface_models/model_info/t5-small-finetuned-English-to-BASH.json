This is a proof of concept model using transfer learning to fine-tune an existing language model and produce structured code instead of natural language. \n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nThis model was trained and evaluated using a custom iteration of [NL2BASH](https://github.com/TellinaTool/nl2bash/tree/master/data). The original NL2BASH dataset contains a large class imbalance with too many bash commands which begin with 'find'. \n\nA maximum threshold was set to remove text/BASH pairs which exceeded the threshold, and [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/) API was used to generate text/BASH pairs for those below the threshold.\n\n~5500 original text/BASH pairs and ~5700 generated text/BASH pairs were used, giving a total of ~11200 lines of text/BASH pairs. Shown below is the class distribution for the top-5 commands.\n![class_balanced.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/moonup/production/uploads/1677215336540-63d8b9876ac3104e50cd9634.png)\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 0.0001\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 16\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- num_epochs: 10\n\n### Training results\n\n| Training Loss | Epoch | Step | Validation Loss | nl2bash_m   | Gen Len |\n|:-------------:|:-----:|:----:|:---------------:|:------:|:-------:|\n| 1.1451        | 1.0   | 561  | 1.3121          | 0.5184 | 13.7475 |\n| 1.4064        | 2.0   | 1122 | 1.1756          | 0.5274 | 14.0812 |\n| 1.3184        | 3.0   | 1683 | 1.1131          | 0.5618 | 13.8323 |\n| 1.2566        | 4.0   | 2244 | 1.0675          | 0.5811 | 13.9099 |\n| 1.195         | 5.0   | 2805 | 1.0312          | 0.5945 | 14.1124 |\n| 1.1459        | 6.0   | 3366 | 1.0064          | 0.6057 | 14.0116 |\n| 1.092         | 7.0   | 3927 | 0.9854          | 0.6094 | 14.0731 |\n| 1.0729        | 8.0   | 4488 | 0.9699          | 0.6159 | 14.1427 |\n| 1.037         | 9.0   | 5049 | 0.9650          | 0.6177 | 14.0455 |\n| 1.0259        | 10.0  | 5610 | 0.9614          | 0.6192 | 14.1044 |\n\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.27.0.dev0\n- Pytorch 1.13.1+cu116\n- Datasets 2.10.0\n- Tokenizers 0.13.2\n", "size_bytes": "242071641", "downloads": 4}
