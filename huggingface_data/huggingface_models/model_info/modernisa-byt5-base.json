It is a fine-tuned version of the multilingual version of the text-to-text transformer ByT5 (Xue et al, 2021, 2022) for translation from 17th century Spanish to modern Spanish. A fine-tuned version of [google/byt5-base](https://huggingface.co/google/byt5-base) trained on a parallel corpus of 44 Spanish-language Golden Age dramas.\n\n- **Developed by:** [Javier de la Rosa](https://huggingface.co/versae)\n- **Shared by [Optional]:** More information needed\n- **Model type:** Transformer\n- **Language(s) (NLP):** es\n- **License:** apache-2.0\n- **Parent Model:** [ByT5-Base](https://huggingface.co/google/byt5-base)\n- **Resources for more information:** More information needed\n    - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/versae/modernisa)\n    - [Associated Paper](https://dh2022.dhii.asia/abstracts/files/DE_LA_ROSA_Javier_The_Moderni_a_Project__Orthographic_Modern.html)\n    - [Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/versae/modernisa)\n\t\n# Uses\n\n<!-- Address questions around how the model is intended to be used, including the foreseeable users of the model and those affected by the model. -->\n\nThe motivation to develop the model was to provide a tool producing normalized text which enables computational analyses (such as distances between texts, clustering, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, stylometry etc.), to facilitate modern editions of historical texts and thus alleviate a job which been done manually so far and to provide a resource which may be used by historians and editors who manually transcribe texts produced in the 17th century which were not yet digitized, which are available in cultural heritage institutions, especially libraries and archives. While all the dramas used are written in verses, the model was not tested on texts in prose; the quality of the translation of prose texts into modern normalized Spanish might therefore differ significantly from the satisfying results achieved with dramas in verses.\n\n## Direct Use\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use without fine-tuning or plugging into a larger ecosystem/app. -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n\nThis resource may be used by historians and editors who manually transcribe texts produced in the 17th century which were not yet digitized and which are typically available in cultural heritage institutions, especially libraries and archives. \n\n\n## Downstream Use [Optional]\n\n<!-- This section is for the model use when fine-tuned for a task, or when plugged into a larger ecosystem/app -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n \nThis model is already fine-tuned.\n\n\n## Out-of-Scope Use\n\n<!-- This section addresses misuse, malicious use, and uses that the model will not work well for. -->\n<!-- If the user enters content, print that. If not, but they enter a task in the list, use that. If neither, say \"more info needed.\" -->\n\n\n\n\n# Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey both technical and sociotechnical limitations. -->\n\nIt has to be underlined that the parallel corpus was created solely from text written by four men who lived in counter-reformatory Spain during the rule of inquisition. The view of the world of these dramatists is from our contemporary point of view outdated, strongly patriarchal, misogynist and discriminatory with respect to non-catholic human beings.\n\n\n## Recommendations\n\n<!-- This section is meant to convey recommendations with respect to the bias, risk, and technical limitations. -->\n\n\nThe intended users of this model are researchers and editors of historical texts. We cannot imagine any harm done by the modernization of those texts as a technical process; however, the reading of such texts may be harmful for persons who are not acquainted with the worldview produced in 17th century Spain. Moreover, linguistic change provides a strong challenge to Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. Vis-\u00e0-vis other languages, linguistic change within the Spanish language was not very pronounced. Further research on the modernization of historical languages is therefore strongly recommended.\n\n\n# Training Details\n\n## Training Data\n\n<!-- This should link to a Data Card, perhaps with a short stub of information on what the training data is all about as well as documentation related to data pre-processing or additional filtering. -->\n\nWe built a parallel corpus of Spanish Golden Age theater texts with pairs of 44 Golden Age dramas in historical orthography and current orthography. Both corpora were aligned line by line to establish a ground truth for the translation between the different historical varieties of Spanish. The 44 dramas have been written by Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n (5), Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca (28), F\u00e9lix Lope de Vega Carpio (6), and Juan P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n (5). The dataset is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/versae/modernisa).\n\n\n## Training Procedure\n\n<!-- This relates heavily to the Technical Specifications.
