Positive reframing induces a complementary positive viewpoint (e.g. glass-half-full) escaping negative patterns. Based on the article [arXiv:2204.02952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02952). \n \n## How to use\n\nThe model uses one or more sentiment strategies concatenated with a sentence and will generate a sentence with the applied sentiment output. The maximum string length is 1024 tokens. Entries must be organized in the following format:\n\n**Input**:\n```\n['growth']: totally fed up with this bid now! :-( haven't even thought about my presentation yet :-(\n```\n\n### Available sentiment strategies:\n\n| Strategy  | Description |\n| --------- | ----------- |\n|**growth** | viewing a challenging event as an opportunity for the author to specifically grow or improve himself.|\n|**impermanence**| Saying that bad things don't last forever, will get better soon, and/or that other people have had similar difficulties.|\n|**neutralizing**| Replacing a negative word with a neutral word. For example, \u201cThis was a terrible day\u201d becomes \u201cThis was a long day\u201d.|\n|**optimism**| Focusing on things about the situation itself, at that moment, that are good (not just predicting a better future).|\n|**self_affirmation**| Talking about what strengths the author already has, or values he admires, such as love, courage, perseverance, etc.|\n|**thankfulness**| Expressing gratitude or gratitude with keywords like appreciate, happy for it, grateful for, good thing, etc.|\n\n### Usage\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline('summarization', \"dominguesm/positive-reframing-en\")\n\ntext = \"['growth']: totally fed up with this bid now! :-( haven't even thought about my presentation yet :-(\"\n\npipe(text, max_length=1024)\n\n```\n\n**Output**:\n\n```\n# I haven't thought about my presentation yet, but I'm going to work hard to improve #my presentation, and I'll be better soon.\n```", "size_bytes": "891697151", "downloads": 7}
