Givena gitdiff file, this model can generate a short commit message summarizing the change.\n\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nThe intended use is to automate github commit message. One limitation to consider is that the model can generate a summary of changes, but is only confined to type of change and might not be able to provide details about the change or output specific keywords related to change. \n\n## Training and evaluation data\n\nMore information needed\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Training hyperparameters\n\nThe following hyperparameters were used during training:\n- learning_rate: 5e-05\n- train_batch_size: 16\n- eval_batch_size: 16\n- seed: 42\n- optimizer: Adam with betas=(0.9,0.999) and epsilon=1e-08\n- lr_scheduler_type: linear\n- lr_scheduler_warmup_steps: 2000\n- num_epochs: 3\n\n### Training results\n\n- global_step=4521\n- training_loss=3.55994465065804\n- train_runtime: 3300.0492\n- train_samples_per_second: 21.919\n- train_steps_per_second: 1.37\n- total_flos: 1.062667587499776e+16\n- train_loss: 3.55994465065804\n\n### Framework versions\n\n- Transformers 4.25.1\n- Pytorch 1.13.0+cu116\n- Tokenizers 0.13.2", "size_bytes": "1135147069", "downloads": 11}
